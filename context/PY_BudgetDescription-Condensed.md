## **1\. Executive Summary**

The AMTAIR project develops computational tools that extract probabilistic world models from AI safety literature to inform governance. Three funding scenarios are proposed:

1. **Austere Budget ($98,500)**: 4-month proof-of-concept focusing on fundamental extraction capabilities  
2. **Baseline Budget ($273,000)**: 12-month implementation with core tools and integrations  
3. **Ambitious Budget ($999,000)**: Enhanced implementation with scaling capabilities and expanded expert involvement

Budget allocations prioritize personnel costs (65-75%), technical infrastructure (15-20%), and administrative/operational expenses (10-15%), with appropriate contingency for each tier.

## **2\. Overview of Budget Scenarios**

The three scenarios represent progressive implementation approaches:

### **Austere Budget: Proof of Concept ($98,500)**

Focuses on demonstrating automated world model extraction using frontier LLMs over 4 months, developing and validating the core AI Risk Pathway Analyzer (ARPA) component.

### **Baseline Budget: Full Implementation ($273,000)**

Enables a 12-month development cycle delivering all core tools: extraction system, worldview comparator, policy evaluation tools, and forecast integration.

### **Ambitious Budget: Enhanced Implementation and Scaling ($999,000)**

Supports a 12-month implementation with expanded expert input, technical outsourcing, enterprise-level infrastructure, and full ecosystem development with community engagement.

## **4\. Budget Narrative**

### **Core Principles**

1. **Personnel-Centric**: 65-75% allocation to skilled researchers and domain experts  
2. **Phased Implementation**: Logical progression from proof-of-concept (Austere) to complete system (Baseline) to scaled capabilities (Ambitious)  
3. **Infrastructure Scaling**: Basic requirements across all budgets, with advanced capabilities in higher tiers  
4. **Expert Validation**: Increasing domain specialist involvement at each tier  
5. **Community Integration**: Substantial engagement allocation in Baseline and Ambitious budgets

### **Impact of Funding Levels**

* **Austere Budget**: Answers "Can frontier LLMs effectively extract causal world models from AI safety literature?" Delivers working ARPA prototype validated against benchmark papers.  
* **Baseline Budget**: Addresses "How can extracted models inform policy and facilitate coordination?" Provides functional ecosystem integrating extraction, comparison, evaluation, and forecasting.  
* **Ambitious Budget**: Tackles "How can we maximize adoption and influence of formal modeling in AI governance?" Enables enterprise-level implementation with substantial expert input and comprehensive community engagement.

### **Cost Efficiency Approaches**

1. **Open-Source Leverage**: Utilizing existing tools where possible, focusing custom development on novel functionalities  
2. **Staged Development**: Prioritizing early delivery of valuable components  
3. **Flexible Resourcing**: Strategic use of part-time support and expert consultation  
4. **Cloud Infrastructure**: Reducing capital expenses while maintaining scaling flexibility

## **5\. Contingency Planning**

### **Risk Factors and Mitigations**

Contingency reserves are calibrated to each implementation scale and risk profile:

1. **LLM Capability Limitations**: If extraction capabilities fall short, funds support hybrid approaches combining automation with manual assistance.  
2. **Computational Requirements**: For complex Bayesian networks requiring greater resources, funds enable additional computing or alternative algorithms.  
3. **Expert Availability**: Flexibility to adjust compensation or timing to secure specialized consultants.  
4. **Integration Complexity**: Reserves allow for additional development time or specialized support when connecting components.

### **Adaptation Mechanisms**

1. **Milestone-Based Assessment**: Validation milestones create natural decision points to reassess and reallocate resources.  
2. **Modular Architecture**: Independent component development allows prioritizing the most promising elements if constraints emerge.  
3. **Scaled Implementation Options**: Core versus enhanced functionality identified for each component, enabling selective implementation based on actual costs.

This budget proposal offers a flexible approach to implementing AMTAIR at different funding levels, with each tier delivering meaningful value while maintaining responsible resource stewardship.
