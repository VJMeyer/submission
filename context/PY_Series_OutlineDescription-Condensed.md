# **The Grand Strategy for AI Risk Series: Outline & Description**

## **The Coordination Crisis and Our Response**

We face a paradox in AI governance: unprecedented investment coexists alongside fundamental coordination failure. Despite millions in funding and growing awareness, we lack the strategic "operating system" to align disparate efforts as AI capabilities rapidly advance.

This coordination gap systematically increases existential risk by generating duplicative work, leaving critical gaps unaddressed, and creating inconsistent approaches. Technical researchers develop solutions without implementation pathways; policy specialists craft frameworks without technical grounding; ethicists articulate principles without operational specificity—a fragmentation that grows more dangerous as capabilities approach human-level intelligence.

**The Grand Strategy for AI Risk Series** addresses this failure by developing a comprehensive framework for strategic alignment across domains, timescales, and stakeholder groups. Drawing on historical examples, analyzing coordination emergence, and evaluating candidate approaches, we bridge theoretical understanding with practical implementation tools. The series integrates siloed disciplines—from strategic studies to governance theory to complex systems—while introducing computational approaches through the AMTAIR project.

## **Series Structure Overview**

\<reasoning\> Key structural changes:

1. Original "Piece 0" split into five posts (0.1-0.5) following Series Introduction  
2. "5-pager" serves as Series Introduction orienting readers  
3. Flow and progression maintained despite restructuring  
4. Integrated stronger elements from "Posts 1-5" and original design  
5. Each piece stands alone while contributing to larger narrative

This provides granular entry points while maintaining comprehensive coverage. \</reasoning\>
