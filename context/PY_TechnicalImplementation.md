# Argument Structures As Bayesian Networks (DataSyntax)

  

## Extraction Algorithm / Workflow:

  

1. **Get** LLM’s to create **ArgDown** “Text” from / based off Authors writing / essay / paper  

2. Extract Data (which fully defines an underlying Bayesian Network) from ArgDown  

   3. Get Nodes:  All \<Arguments/Premises\> and all \[Statements/Conclusions\]  

   4. Edges:   “Parent function”: For each Node;   Which Nodes “link to this Node (arrow incoming from which other Nodes)”  

      5. “Beginnings” of the Graph / Premises:   All Nodes which do not have parents (= Pa(X) \=0)  

      6. “Ends” of the Graph / Final Conclusions (maybe implications):   All Nodes without Children Notes (= Nodes that are not part of any Pa(X) function)  

   7. *Together the Nodes & Edges already fully specify the structure of the DAG / Bayesian Network:*  

      8. *This can be captured by the Matrix of “Nodes \* Nodes” where each cell “contains” the joint probability distribution of  Node X \* Node Y (such as P(**X,Y))** iff there is a link from X to Y (or Y to X) .*  

         *If a cell is empty the is no direct link between the corresponding Nodes*  

      9. *Screenshot of spreadsheet with illustration*  

      10. *what about the directions of the links?*  

      11. *Explain how the "location" of an entry/link specifies if e.g. A to B or B to A...*  

   12. Obtain the full “conditional probability distributions” for each Node  

      13. For each parent of the node, fetch all possible instantiations  

         14. E.g. A= a and A= not a and B=b and B= not b …  

      15. The dimensions (and Complexity) of each joint probability table/distribution are:   \~ possible instantiations of parent variables ^ number of parent variables  

         16. This results in a table with a row for each possible instantiation of each parent Variable and (same but inverted) a column for each possible instantiation of each parent Variable  

      17. Each cell of the probability table has a “unique” interpretation/value/meaning:  

         18. Each entry of the table describes the “conditional probability for that specific  combination of instantiation of the parent variables”  

            19. E.g.: p( b | not a) is the “probability of B=b given that A \= not a  

         20. (Iteratively) The extracting LLM is prompted to “answer / best guess” the “\~authors intended/implied” probability for each entry.  

             E.g.: “Given the (entire) Paper/Graph what would be the authors best guess for the probability of \[*Node in Question X*\] taking the value \[*instantiation of X (E.g.: X \= not x)* \] conditional on the parent node \[*Y*\] having the value \[*possible instantiations of Y*\] {This needs to be asked/answered for each possible instantiation of each node and for each possible instantiation of each parent}  

         3.   

      21. *Screenshot of spreadsheet with illustration*  

         22. \~ both "sub-tables" can be translated into each other using Bayes theorem.  

         2.   

         23. They contain the same information but depending on the source one or the other "formulation" might be easier to obtain.  

         24. Is this actually true or are the tables different and "depend on the direction of the causality/arrow / flow of information"?  

         5.   

      25. The sums of each row and each columns provide the “*unconditional probabilities for the possible instantiations*” for each variable  

         26. Mathematically, they have to always sum up to 1\.  

            27. Sometimes this might allow “reverse inference”   

               28. E.g.: given a set of explicit statements about the total probabilities for a variable (and some of the conditional probabilities) it might be simple to calculate the remaining, implied probabilities using Bayes Theorem.  

      29. Given the complete, conditional probability distributions for all variables fully defines the entire Bayesian Network (aka “are sufficient to calculate/fully define the entire joint probability distribution):  

         30. [In probability theory, the **joint probability distribution** is the probability distribution of all possible pairs of outputs of two random variables that are defined on the same probability space. The joint distribution can just as well be considered for any given number of random variables. The joint distribution encodes the marginal distributions, i.e. the distributions of each of the individual random variables and the conditional probability distributions, which deal with how the outputs of one random variable are distributed when given information on the outputs of the other random variable(s).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_probability_distribution)  

         2.   

      31. *Wikipedia:*  

         *Each node is associated with a probability function that takes, as input, a particular set of values for the node's parent variables, and gives (as output) the probability (or probability distribution, if applicable) of the variable represented by the node.*  

   32. *Iterate over the entire above workflow to “estimate/approximate” the uncertainty from the differences in LLM outputs/responses*  

      33. *Similar / converging outputs/results imply that underlying model/estimates are probably quite precise/stable (low meta-uncertainty / high credence in estimates / extraction / process / results) — small range of estimates → small uncertainty*  

      34. *Different / diverging outputs/results imply that underlying model/estimates are probably quite imprecise/unstable (high meta-uncertainty / low credence in estimates / extraction / process / results) — wide range of estimates → large uncertainty*  

      35. *Where / how can “results” be different or similar?*  

         36. *Structure of the graph / Argdown extraction*  

            37. *Different Nodes identified*  

            38. *Different Links identified*  

         39. *Values / Estimates of the conditional probabilities differ (or converge)*   

         40. *…*

  

  

41. *\[**Maybe:**\] Verify / Check the Bayesian Network*  

   42. *\~ Make sure the math adds up*  

   43. *\~ Check if the resulting graph (generated from the extracted data) has the same structure as the original ArgDown Graph*  

44. **Run Inference / Analysis / Counterfactuals / Explanations / Predictions / Sensitivity Analysis etc.**

  

### Remaining Key Questions / Extensions:

  

* What are the formula’s / math for the continuous case?  

* Are correlations fully accounted for?  

* Are the definitions / distinctions between joint probability distributions, conditional probability distributions and marginal probability distributions clear?  

  * What are the exact math “rules”/formulas/equations that govern probability tables?  

    * What are those in the continuous case?  

  * How can you calculate “one table from other tables”?  

* Can we really explain the meaning of the directions of arrows?

  
  
  
  
  

## [Probabilistic argument mapping and undercut relations · christianvoigt argdown · Discussion \#250 · GitHub](https://github.com/christianvoigt/argdown/discussions/250)

  

Hi there Christian,

  

I really like Argdown and I plan on using it in the future a lot. In general, it works great regarding argument mapping. I would like it to explicitly show the undercut/rebuff/undermine relations, but these can be implicitly derived from the structure anyway.

  

What I would really look forward to is the implementation of probabilistic argument mapping. Currently the relations are 3-fold: positive support (+), negative support (-), is strictly contrary to (\>\<) (if I am missing something please let me know, I am just starting with Argdown).

  

However, real argument building in our minds happens more in a probabilistic manner. An example would be where a conclusion (inference) is supported by three 100%-strong statements/nodes, and negatively supported by one 100%-strong statement, which would render the support for the conclusion at 75%.

  

Can this be implemented and do you have any plans doing so?

  

I am a philosopher, so can't help with the technical stuff. However, if I would go about this would be:

  

implement ability to pre-define nodes as the either of two types: fuzzy (rational number between 0 and 1; where 0.5 would be the middle point) and strict (extended boolean: either 0, 0.5 or 1);  

fuzzy and strict nodes would have strength that reflects the support they get from other statements that somehow (positively or negatively) relate to them;  

if there are no such other statements that lead to them, nodes will have a default strength value of 1 (since if one is including a node in his argument map, it is a fully-strength one anyway), unless one explicitly redefines the strength value;  

strict nodes are 1 if their support exceeds 0.5, 0 if it is below 0.5, 0.5 if it is exactly 0.5; a range of tolerance around 0.5 i.e. 1% might be acceptable here as well as a property that can be enabled;  

the strength of the supporting or non-supporting relation would be reflective of the strength of the node; positive support is straightforwardly reflective of the strength of the node, negative support is reflective of the node strength multiplied by \-1;  

Example:

  

Statement 1a: strength \= 0.75  

Statement 1b: strength \= 0.8  

Statement 1c: strength \= 0.4

  

Conclusion 1, positively supported by 1a and 1b, but negatively supported by 1c: strength \= 0.6917 (rounded)

  

Why?

  

Because 0.75 \+ 0.8 \+ (0.4 \* \-1) \= 1.15  

Then we derive the average: 1.15 / 3 \= 0.3833  

Finally we add 1 (to retrieve the value out from the negative range) and divide with 2 (to render it within the range of 0 and 1): (0.3833 \+ 1\) / 2 \= 1.3833 / 2 \= 0.691666667

  

Let me know what you think. This was out of the top of my head, the formulae might be wrong. And let me know if I can help in any way i.e. by donating, conceptualising, etc.

Hi, thanks for your interest in Argdown. Before I get to your main topic, just a quick tip: Argdown already has an undercut relation (\<\_). Here is how you use it:

  

\<a\>  

    \_\> \<b\>

  

\<a\>

  

(1) s1  

(2) s2  

\-----  

    \<\_ \[t1\]  

(3) s3  

Now, regarding "probabilistic" inferences. In general Argdown is not restricted to deductive inferences. Either you can use non-deductive inference patterns or you can make the uncertainty explicit in your statements ("It is probable that", "It is possible that", or "It is scientific consensus that..." and so on). I think the latter method has many advantages as you can still use deductive logic and the statements are expressing much clearer what is actually under discussion.

  

However, what you are interested in is the quantification of "how well a statement is justified" in a debate. So I think what you are talking about are "degrees of justification" which is a topic Gregor Betz (whose Debatelab is funding Argdown development) has written a lot about. Check out this article for example.

  

Adding something like this to Argdown is possible without changing the syntax. It is one of the many purposes of statement/argument metadata. You can add any data you want to statements (another typical use case would be formalizations):

  

\[Man-made\]: Climate change is man-made { doj: 0.9 }  

To use this kind of data for automatic calculations Argdown users can write custom plugins that read and transform data (including metadata) (in the case of formalizations one could use an automatic proof checker). I will gladly answer any questions by plugin developers.

  

One thing that is still missing though, is the ability of plugins to enhance or format the original Argdown document (for example adding calculation results back to the metadata). At the moment the output of an Argdown data transformation is always in another format (an "export") and not reintegrated into your code. That is something that is on my long-term todo list.

  

Such a "degree of justification"-plugin should not be part of the core of Argdown as this is a controversial area of research and Argdown tries hard to not be theoretically opiniated. But it would definitely be a fascinating experimental feature\!

Hey Christian,

  

Thanks for your reply.

  

First, let me ask you about the undercut you mentioned. As I can see the undercut defeats a node, whereas it should defeat the relationship between two nodes (on the visual map) i.e. the undercut should attack the inference. Yes, it is marked with purple, but it still points to a node instead of the relationship arrow. That means that it defeats the node which might be pointing to additional nodes through inferences that are valid. Do you have any plans on changing/amending this?

  

Now, on probabilistic inferences. The ability to add any metadata is great, and I believe this can be used to define the strengths. However, there should be a reasoning engine (a proof checker, as you say) that will perform calculations that perpetuate down the chain, and update the graph on any updates. I showed above that calculations in this manner are not very complex. They need to start from the bottom of the tree and propagate to the top, though, and if the tree is complex this can have computational implications (but not something undoable by today's PCs for sure).

  

I don't know who can do this, but it'd be great if this can be done. If only I had the time to learn Typescript now :D

  

Anyway, I agree that this would be a fascinating experimental feature. Hope someone will step in and do it. Or maybe you can do it and sell this plugin, as a way of self-financing. I would be sure to purchase it.

This is based on a misunderstanding of Argdown argument maps (which differ from other kinds of argument maps): In other argument maps, arguments simply link a set of premises together and their outgoing arrows represent the inference to the conclusion. In contrast, in Argdown inferences and conclusions are contained within (logically reconstructed) arguments, as each argument consists of (possibly complex) premise-conclusion structures. An argument can contain several inferential steps and thus actually can represent a whole inference tree.

  

We do this for two reasons: First, as philosphers, we are used to reconstruct arguments as lists of statements representing inference trees and we wanted to keep true to this tradition of argument reconstruction. Secondly, allowing arguments to contain complex inference trees allows us to drastically reduce the visual complexity of argument maps. This makes it possible to visualize huge debates.

  

Undercuts actually attack the inferential steps within arguments:

  

(1) first premise  

(2) second premise  

\----  

    \<\_ undercut against this inference  

(3) intermediary conclusion  

(4) third premise  

\----  

(5) main conclusion  

A purple arrow in the argument map between two arguments means that the attacking argument attacks an inferential step inside of that argument's premise-conclusion structure (in contrast to a "normal" attack, which attacks a premise within the argument).

  

A green arrow between an argument and a statement actually does not represent the inference from that argument's premises to its conclusion. Instead it means that if the argument's conclusion is true, the supported statement has to be true as well (the conclusion logically-semantically entails the statement).

  

A green arrow from argument a to argument b means that if the conclusion of argument a is true, a premise of argument b has to be true as well. See here for more information on what the arrows mean in Argdown.

  

You can not attack a green arrow, as it should only be used for entailment relations that are necessarily true based on the meaning of the used statements. Deductive or non-deductive inferences (which can be attacked with undercuts) are instead added in the logical reconstructions of arguments, not by "adding arrows".

  

This all makes more sense in "strict" mode where each argument is logically reconstructed and all relations can be derived from logico-semantical relations between statements. If you do not reconstruct premise-conclusion structures this might indeed seem confusing at first. But in this case you should think of the relations as simply making first assumptions (sketching out) what logico-semantical relations would exist if one were to fully reconstruct all premise-conclusion structures.

# 2\. LLM-Powered Text to ArgDown Conversion

  

The first substantive challenge in extracting world models from AI governance literature is converting natural language arguments—with all their nuance, implicit reasoning, and rhetorical complexity—into a structured format suitable for further computational processing. While humans can often intuitively grasp argument structures in text, automated extraction requires an intermediate representation that balances expressivity with formal rigor. We use ArgDown as this intermediate representation, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to perform the conversion from unstructured text.

  

## **2.1 ArgDown Syntax for Causal Arguments**

  

ArgDown provides a markdown-like syntax for representing arguments that strikes an effective balance between human readability and machine processability. Its core elements map cleanly to the components needed for causal argument representation:

  

* **Statements/conclusions** are represented within square brackets: `[Statement]`  

* **Premises/evidence** are represented within angle brackets: `<Premise>`  

* **Support relationships** are indicated with an arrow (`=>`) connecting premises to the statements they support  

* **Attack relationships** are indicated with a negated arrow (`=/=>`) connecting rebuttals to the statements they contradict  

* **Undercutting relationships** are indicated with a specialized notation (`=|=>`) for premises that challenge the inferential connection rather than the conclusion itself

  

For instance, consider this excerpt from Carlsmith's paper on AI risk:

  

"I expect creating a fully PS-aligned APS system to be very difficult, relative to creating a less-than-fully PS-aligned one with very useful capabilities—especially in a paradigm akin to current machine learning..."

  

This might be converted to ArgDown as:

  

\<Current ML paradigms rely on optimizing against behavioral metrics\> \=\>   

\[Creating fully PS-aligned APS systems is more difficult than creating useful but misaligned systems\]

  

\<Optimization against behavioral metrics makes controlling objectives harder\> \=\>  

\[Creating fully PS-aligned APS systems is more difficult than creating useful but misaligned systems\]

  

To capture probabilistic elements that are often implicit in AI governance literature, we extend the standard ArgDown syntax with additional notation for expressing likelihoods:

  

\<Current ML paradigms rely on optimizing against behavioral metrics\> \=0.9=\>   

\[Creating fully PS-aligned APS systems is more difficult than creating useful but misaligned systems\]

  

This extended syntax indicates that the premise supports the conclusion with an approximately 90% strength of inference—information that will later be critical for constructing conditional probability tables.

  

## **2.2 Prompt Engineering for ArgDown Extraction**

  

Converting natural language arguments to ArgDown requires carefully engineered prompts for LLMs. Through extensive experimentation, we've found that a two-stage prompting strategy yields superior results:

  

1. **Identification Stage**: First, identify all statements and premises in the text  

2. **Structuring Stage**: Then, determine the relationships between these elements

  

For the identification stage, we use prompts like:

  

Analyze the following text from an AI governance paper and identify:  

1\. All main claims or conclusions (these will become statements in brackets)  

2\. All supporting evidence or reasoning (these will become premises in angle brackets)

  

Extract these elements without altering their meaning, but simplify complex sentences   

if necessary. Ensure each statement or premise stands on its own semantically.

  

Text: "{source\_text}"

  

For the structuring stage, we use:

  

For each statement identified below, determine which premises support or attack it.   

Format your response using ArgDown syntax:  

\- Statements in square brackets: \[Statement\]  

\- Premises in angle brackets: \<Premise\>  

\- Support relationships indicated by "=\>"  

\- Attack relationships indicated by "=/=\>"

  

Statements and premises:  

{list\_of\_statements\_and\_premises}

  

When extracting probabilistic information, we add:

  

If the text implies a confidence level or probability for any relationship between  

a premise and statement, indicate this as a decimal before the arrow. For example:  

\<Premise\> \=0.8=\> \[Statement\] means the premise supports the statement with   

approximately 80% confidence.

  

These prompts are refined through iterative experimentation, as different source materials may require subtle adjustments to the prompting strategy.

  

## **2.3 Handling Common Extraction Challenges**

  

Several challenges arise when extracting argument structures from AI governance literature:

  

### **Implicit Premises**

  

AI governance papers often rely on unstated assumptions that are common knowledge within the field. For example, an argument about AI alignment failure might not explicitly state the premise that "unaligned AI systems would pursue goals different from human intentions." LLMs can identify these implicit premises by drawing on their training data, but require specific guidance:

  

Identify any important unstated assumptions or implicit premises that the author relies   

on but does not explicitly state. These should be premises that, if false, would   

significantly weaken the argument.

  

### **Conditional and Hypothetical Arguments**

  

AI governance literature frequently employs conditional reasoning ("If X were to happen, then Y would likely result") and hypothetical scenarios. We capture these by treating conditions as premises with special notation:

  

\<If advanced AI systems are developed using current ML techniques\> \=\[condition\]=\>   

\<The difficulty of alignment will increase\>

  

\<The difficulty of alignment will increase\> \=\>   

\[Existential risk from misaligned AI becomes more likely\]

  

### **Citation-Backed Claims**

  

Authors often support arguments with citations rather than direct reasoning. We treat cited evidence as a special type of premise, maintaining provenance information:

  

\<Prior work has demonstrated increasing returns to scale in AI capabilities (Smith et al., 2023)\> \=\[citation\]=\>   

\[AI capabilities will likely continue to advance rapidly\]

  

### **Ambiguous Causal Relationships**

  

Some arguments describe correlations without clearly specifying causal direction. In these cases, we instruct the LLM to make a best guess but flag ambiguity:

  

\<Increased compute resources\> \=\[ambiguous\_causality:0.7\]=\>   

\[Faster AI capability development\]

  

## **2.4 Quality Assurance and Validation**

  

Even state-of-the-art LLMs make mistakes in argument extraction. We employ several validation techniques:

  

1. **Multiple Extraction Runs**: We perform several extraction runs using different prompts or model versions, comparing results to identify inconsistencies.

  

2. **Consistency Checking**: We verify logical consistency within the extracted ArgDown:

  

   * Every premise should support or attack at least one statement  

   * Support and attack relationships should not contradict each other  

   * Circular reasoning should be flagged  

3. **Human Validation**: Critical arguments undergo human review, comparing the ArgDown representation to the original text to ensure fidelity.

  

4. **Common Error Correction**: We apply automated fixes for common LLM extraction errors:

  

   * Merging nearly identical premises or statements  

   * Splitting compound statements that contain multiple claims  

   * Standardizing terminology across related arguments

  

This quality assurance process is iterative, with feedback from validation informing improvements to the extraction prompts.

  

# **3\. Bayesian Network Structure Extraction from ArgDown**

  

Once we have a structured ArgDown representation of the arguments in a text, the next step is to convert this representation into a Bayesian network structure—specifically, a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where nodes represent variables and edges represent causal relationships between them.

  

## **3.1 Node Identification and Classification**

  

Nodes in our Bayesian network correspond to the statements and premises in the ArgDown representation, with each node representing a variable that can take different values (typically true or false). We extract nodes using the following procedure:

  

1. For each statement `[S]` in the ArgDown, create a corresponding node in the graph  

2. For each premise `<P>` in the ArgDown, create a corresponding node in the graph  

3. Assign each node a unique identifier based on a normalized version of its text  

4. Classify nodes by type (statement, premise) and other metadata (source location, confidence)

  

For example, from Carlsmith's paper, the statement:

  

\[Advanced AI systems will likely have power-seeking incentives\]

  

Becomes a node in our graph with:

  

* Identifier: `advanced_ai_power_seeking_incentives`  

* Type: `statement`  

* Source: `Carlsmith2021`  

* Text: The original statement text

  

We maintain bidirectional mappings between ArgDown elements and graph nodes to ensure traceability back to the source material.

  

## **3.2 Edge Extraction and Directionality**

  

Edges in our Bayesian network represent causal influences between variables. ArgDown relationships map to edges as follows:

  

1. **Support relationships** (`=>`) become positive causal links, with an edge directed from the premise node to the statement node  

2. **Attack relationships** (`=/=>`) become negative causal links, similarly directed from premise to statement  

3. **Undercutting relationships** (`=|=>`) require special handling, as they modify other relationships rather than directly connecting nodes

  

The directionality of edges is critical. In a Bayesian network, an edge from node A to node B indicates that A causally influences B, which in the context of arguments means that accepting premise A affects the likelihood of accepting statement B. This directional relationship is fundamental to the conditional probability structure we'll develop later.

  

Consider this ArgDown fragment:

  

\<Increasing AI capabilities will outpace safety measures\> \=\>   

\[Risk of AI accidents will grow\]

  

\<Strong international coordination on AI safety\> \=/=\>   

\[Risk of AI accidents will grow\]

  

This yields a graph with three nodes and two edges:

  

* An edge from `increasing_ai_capabilities_outpace_safety` to `risk_of_ai_accidents_grows` with a positive weight  

* An edge from `strong_international_coordination` to `risk_of_ai_accidents_grows` with a negative weight

  

Importantly, we don't create edges between statements and premises that have no direct relationship in the ArgDown. The network structure emerges from the explicitly modeled relationships.

  

## **3.3 DAG Construction Algorithm**

  

The algorithm for constructing the Directed Acyclic Graph from ArgDown is implemented as follows:

  

Algorithm: ArgDown-to-DAG  

Input: ArgDown document D  

Output: Directed Acyclic Graph G(V,E)

  

1\. Initialize empty node set V and edge set E  

2\. For each statement \[S\] and premise \<P\> in D:  

   a. Create node n with properties extracted from S or P  

   b. Add n to V  

3\. For each relationship R in D:  

   a. Identify source node Ns (premise) and target node Nt (statement)  

   b. Determine relationship type (support, attack, undercut)  

   c. Create edge e from Ns to Nt with weight and type based on R  

   d. Add e to E  

4\. Check for cycles in G(V,E)  

   a. If cycles exist, resolve using domain-specific rules (see below)  

5\. Return G(V,E)

  

This algorithm creates a graph where each node corresponds to a statement or premise, and each edge corresponds to a support or attack relationship. The weight of each edge is determined by the strength of the relationship, either explicitly stated in the ArgDown (e.g., `=0.8=>`) or inferred from context.

  

### **Handling Cycles**

  

A valid Bayesian network must be acyclic, but argument structures sometimes contain cycles due to mutual support or definitional relationships. We resolve cycles using the following heuristics:

  

1. **Definitional Relationships**: If A supports B and B supports A because they are definitionally related, merge A and B into a single node  

2. **Temporal Separation**: If a cycle involves a temporal sequence, break it at the point furthest in the future  

3. **Weakest Link Removal**: If neither of the above applies, remove the edge with the lowest confidence score

  

For example, if we encounter:

  

\<Advanced AI will seek power\> \=\> \[Advanced AI poses an existential risk\]  

\<Advanced AI poses an existential risk\> \=\> \[We should regulate AI development\]  

\<We should regulate AI development\> \=\> \[Advanced AI will seek less power\]

  

We have a cycle. Identifying "Advanced AI will seek less power" as a temporal consequence of regulation, we break the cycle by removing or specially marking the last edge.

  

## **3.4 Graph Structure Validation**

  

Before proceeding to probability assignment, we validate the constructed graph to ensure it faithfully represents the original arguments and meets the requirements of a Bayesian network:

  

1. **Acyclicity Verification**: Confirm the graph contains no directed cycles  

2. **Connectedness Analysis**: Identify disconnected subgraphs that might indicate missed relationships  

3. **Root and Leaf Node Identification**: Verify that source premises (with no parents) and final conclusions (with no children) align with the logical structure of the original text  

4. **Structural Alignment Check**: Compare the graph structure to the original argument flow to ensure major argumentative moves are preserved

  

This validation step is crucial because the Bayesian network structure determines what probabilistic queries we can answer and how efficiently we can compute them.

  

# **4\. Extracting Conditional Probability Distributions**

  

With the structure of the Bayesian network established, we now need to populate it with probability distributions. For each node in the network, we must specify a conditional probability distribution that quantifies how the node's value depends on the values of its parent nodes.

  

## **4.1 Probability Table Structure and Requirements**

  

Each node X in a Bayesian network requires a conditional probability table (CPT) that specifies P(X|Parents(X)). For binary variables (which most of our nodes will be), this means specifying:

  

* P(X=true|Parents(X)=configuration1)  

* P(X=true|Parents(X)=configuration2)  

* ...and so on for all possible configurations of parent values

  

The size of this table grows exponentially with the number of parents:

  

* A node with 0 parents needs 1 probability value (just P(X=true))  

* A node with 1 binary parent needs 2 values  

* A node with 2 binary parents needs 4 values  

* A node with n binary parents needs 2^n values

  

For example, consider a node "Risk of misalignment increases" with two parents: "AI capabilities advance rapidly" and "Alignment research lags". The CPT looks like:

  

| Capabilities Advance | Alignment Lags | P(Risk Increases=true) |

| ----- | ----- | ----- |

| true | true | 0.95 |

| true | false | 0.60 |

| false | true | 0.45 |

| false | false | 0.10 |

  

For nodes with many parents, the CPT can become unwieldy. In these cases, we may employ simplifying assumptions like noisy-OR or noisy-AND, or use parameterized representations that require fewer values.

  

## **4.2 LLM-Based Probability Extraction**

  

The key innovation in our approach is using LLMs to estimate the conditional probabilities implied by the original text. For each node and parent configuration, we prompt the LLM to estimate the probability value that best reflects the author's implied beliefs.

  

Our basic prompt template is:

  

Given the paper by {author} on {topic}, consider the following statements:

  

1\. {Parent1}: "{parent1\_text}"  

2\. {Parent2}: "{parent2\_text}"  

...  

X. {TargetNode}: "{target\_node\_text}"

  

Assuming statements 1 through {n} are {parent\_values}, what probability would the author   

assign to statement X being true? Base your assessment only on what's stated or strongly   

implied in the paper.

  

Explain your reasoning step by step, then provide a single probability value between 0 and 1\.

  

For example, using Carlsmith's paper:

  

Given the paper by Carlsmith on existential risk from power-seeking AI, consider the   

following statements:

  

1\. AI CAPABILITIES: "Advanced AI systems will have superhuman capabilities in domains   

   that confer significant power"  

2\. ALIGNMENT DIFFICULTY: "Creating fully PS-aligned APS systems is more difficult than   

   creating useful but misaligned systems"  

3\. RISK LEVEL: "AI systems pose an existential risk to humanity"

  

Assuming AI CAPABILITIES is TRUE and ALIGNMENT DIFFICULTY is TRUE, what probability would   

Carlsmith assign to RISK LEVEL being true? Base your assessment only on what's stated or   

strongly implied in the paper.

  

Explain your reasoning step by step, then provide a single probability value between 0 and 1\.

  

The LLM responds with a reasoning trace and a probability estimate. We extract the final probability value and add it to the CPT for the node.

  

For explicit probability statements in the text (like Carlsmith's "65%" for certain propositions), we use these values directly. For implicit probabilities, we rely on the LLM's understanding of the author's reasoning and confidence levels.

  

## **4.3 Probability Consistency Enforcement**

  

Raw LLM-generated probabilities may not satisfy the consistency requirements of a valid Bayesian network. We enforce these constraints through post-processing:

  

1. **Row Normalization**: For each configuration of parent values, ensure P(X=true) \+ P(X=false) \= 1  

2. **Parent-Child Consistency**: Apply Bayes' theorem to verify consistency between related probabilities:  

   * P(Child|Parent) \= P(Parent,Child) / P(Parent)  

   * P(Parent,Child) \= P(Child|Parent) \* P(Parent)  

3. **Joint Probability Factorization**: Ensure the product of all CPTs yields a valid joint distribution

  

When inconsistencies are detected, we prioritize probabilities directly extracted from the text, then those with highest LLM confidence, adjusting other values to maintain consistency.

  

### **Reverse Inference for Missing Values**

  

In some cases, an author may specify marginal probabilities but not conditionals, or vice versa. We can use Bayes' theorem to infer missing values:

  

If we know:

  

* P(A) \= 0.3 (marginal probability of A)  

* P(B|A) \= 0.8 (conditional probability of B given A)

  

We can calculate:

  

* P(A,B) \= P(B|A) \* P(A) \= 0.8 \* 0.3 \= 0.24  

* P(B) \= P(B|A) \* P(A) \+ P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A) \= 0.8 \* 0.3 \+ P(B|¬A) \* 0.7

  

If we also know:

  

* P(B) \= 0.5 (from elsewhere in the text)

  

Then:

  

* 0.5 \= 0.24 \+ P(B|¬A) \* 0.7  

* P(B|¬A) \= (0.5 \- 0.24) / 0.7 ≈ 0.37

  

This reverse inference process allows us to fill in gaps in the probability tables while maintaining consistency with the author's stated beliefs.

  

## **4.4 Uncertainty Quantification in Extracted Probabilities**

  

Probabilities extracted by LLMs come with inherent uncertainty. We quantify this uncertainty through:

  

1. **Multiple Extraction Runs**: Generating several estimates using different prompts or models  

2. **Confidence Intervals**: Calculating ranges around each probability value based on variation across runs  

3. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Identifying which probability values have the largest impact on downstream inferences

  

For probabilities with high uncertainty, we may:

  

* Flag them for human review  

* Use broader probability intervals in subsequent analyses  

* Apply more conservative inference methods that account for estimation uncertainty

  

This meta-uncertainty becomes part of the model itself, allowing later analyses to distinguish between conclusions that are robust to estimation error and those that are sensitive to specific probability values.

  

# **5\. Representing the Complete Bayesian Network**

  

With both structure (DAG) and parameters (CPTs) in place, we now have a complete Bayesian network representation of the world model implicit in the original text. This section addresses how this representation is formalized mathematically and implemented computationally.

  

## **5.1 Mathematical Formalization**

  

The fundamental property of a Bayesian network is that it represents the joint probability distribution over all variables in a factorized form:

  

P(X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ) \= ∏ₖ₌₁ᵗᵒⁿ P(Xₖ | Parents(Xₖ))

  

This factorization is what makes Bayesian networks computationally tractable compared to naive approaches that would require storing the full joint distribution.

  

In our case, each variable typically represents a statement or premise that can be true or false. The joint distribution represents the probability of any specific combination of truth values across all statements and premises in the extracted model.

  

Importantly, this factorization is only valid because our graph is acyclic and the conditional independence assumptions encoded in the graph structure hold (or at least, approximate the author's implied beliefs reasonably well).

  

### **Variable Instantiation and Evidence**

  

To perform inference, we often want to compute conditional probabilities of the form:

  

P(Query | Evidence) \= P(Query, Evidence) / P(Evidence)

  

Where:

  

* Query is a set of variables we want to know about  

* Evidence is a set of variables we have observed values for

  

For example, we might want to know:

  

P(ExistentialRisk=true | AICapabilitiesAdvance=true, AlignmentResearchSucceeds=false)

  

The Bayesian network structure allows efficient computation of such queries using algorithms like variable elimination, junction trees, or sampling methods.

  

## **5.2 Implementation Data Structures**

  

We implement our Bayesian network using specialized data structures optimized for efficient storage and inference:

  

1. **Node Structure**: Each node contains:

  

   * Unique identifier  

   * Original text  

   * Variable type (typically binary)  

   * Conditional probability table  

   * Metadata (source, confidence, etc.)  

2. **Edge Structure**: Each edge contains:

  

   * Source and target node identifiers  

   * Relationship type (support, attack)  

   * Weight (strength of influence)  

   * Metadata (extracted confidence, etc.)  

3. **Graph Structure**: The overall graph is represented as:

  

   * Node adjacency list (for each node, its parents and children)  

   * Topological ordering of nodes (for efficient inference)  

4. **Conditional Probability Tables**: CPTs are stored efficiently using:

  

   * Sparse representations for large tables with many identical values  

   * Factorized representations for nodes with special structure (e.g., noisy-OR)  

   * Probability intervals for values with high uncertainty

  

For compatibility with existing Bayesian network software like PyMC3, BayesiaLab, or SMILE, we implement export functions to standard formats like XMLBIF or JSON.

  

## **5.3 Representation Verification**

  

Before proceeding to inference and analysis, we verify that our representation is mathematically valid and maintains fidelity to the source material:

  

1. **Mathematical Consistency Checks**:

  

   * Verify all probability values are between 0 and 1  

   * Ensure CPT rows sum to 1 for discrete variables  

   * Confirm joint probability sums to 1 across all possible variable assignments  

2. **Structure-Probability Alignment**:

  

   * Verify that edge directions match the conditional probability structure  

   * Check that nodes with no parents have valid prior distributions  

   * Ensure terminal nodes (no children) have fully specified CPTs  

3. **Comparison with Original ArgDown**:

  

   * Trace key argument chains from premises to conclusions in both representations  

   * Verify that all major claims and supporting evidence are represented  

   * Check that probability values align with explicit statements in the text  

4. **Lossless Conversion Validation**:

  

   * Generate ArgDown from the Bayesian network and compare to the original  

   * Identify any information lost in the conversion process  

   * Adjust representations to minimize information loss

  

These verification steps ensure that the Bayesian network is not just mathematically valid, but also a faithful representation of the world model implicit in the original text.

  

With a verified Bayesian network in place, we can now proceed to inference, analysis, and comparison across different sources or worldviews—tasks that leverage the formal structure we've constructed to derive insights that might not be apparent from the original text alone. \</draft\>
