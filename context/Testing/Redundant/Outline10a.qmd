## Abstract {.unnumbered}

<!-- [ ] Write a concise overview of the coordination crisis in AI governance, the AMTAIR approach, and key innovations -->

> The coordination crisis in AI governance presents a paradoxical challenge: unprecedented investment in AI safety coexists alongside fundamental coordination failures across technical, policy, and ethical domains. These divisions systematically increase existential risk. This thesis introduces AMTAIR (Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling), a computational approach addressing this coordination failure by automating the extraction of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature using frontier language models. The system implements an end-to-end pipeline transforming unstructured text into interactive Bayesian networks through a novel two-stage extraction process that bridges communication gaps between stakeholders.










## Introduction {#sec-introduction}



### The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance {#sec-coordination-crisis}

<!-- [ ] Frame the problem as coordination failure rather than merely technical challenge --> 
<!-- [ ] Document how fragmentation systematically increases risk through safety gaps, resource misallocation, and negative-sum dynamics -->

As AI capabilities advance at an accelerating pace—demonstrated by the rapid progression from GPT-3 to GPT-4, Claude, and beyond—we face a governance challenge unlike any in human history: how to ensure increasingly powerful AI systems remain aligned with human values and beneficial to humanity's long-term flourishing. This challenge becomes particularly acute when considering the possibility of transformative AI systems that could drastically alter civilization's trajectory, potentially including existential risks from misaligned systems.

> Despite unprecedented investment in AI safety research, rapidly growing awareness among key stakeholders, and proliferating frameworks for responsible AI development, we face what I'll term the "coordination crisis" in AI governance—a systemic failure to align diverse efforts across technical, policy, and strategic domains into a coherent response proportionate to the risks we face.

`The AI governance landscape exhibits a peculiar paradox: extraordinary activity alongside fundamental coordination failure. Consider the current state of affairs:

Technical safety researchers develop increasingly sophisticated alignment techniques, but often without clear implementation pathways to deployment contexts. Policy specialists craft principles and regulatory frameworks without sufficient technical grounding to ensure their practical efficacy. Ethicists articulate normative principles that lack operational specificity. Strategy researchers identify critical uncertainties but struggle to translate these into actionable guidance.`

#### Historical Parallels and Temporal Urgency {#sec-historical-parallels}








### Research Question and Scope {#sec-research-question}

<!-- [ ] Clearly articulate the primary research question --> 
<!-- [ ] Define each component with precision --> 
<!-- [ ] Establish boundaries of the investigation -->

This thesis addresses a specific dimension of the coordination challenge by investigating the question: **Can frontier AI technologies be utilized to automate the modeling of transformative AI risks, enabling robust prediction of policy impacts?**

To break this down into its components:

- **Frontier AI technologies** refers to today's most capable AI systems (e.g., GPT-4 level large language models)
- **Automation of modeling** involves using these systems to formalize the worldviews and arguments underlying AI safety discourse
- **Transformative AI risks** focuses specifically on potentially catastrophic outcomes from advanced AI systems
- **Policy impact prediction** refers to evaluating how governance interventions might alter the probability distribution of outcomes

The scope encompasses both theoretical development and practical implementation. Theoretically, I develop a framework for representing diverse perspectives on AI risk in a common formal language. Practically, I implement this framework in a computational system—the AI Risk Pathway Analyzer (ARPA)—that enables interactive exploration of how policy interventions might alter existential risk.






### The Multiplicative Benefits Framework {#sec-multiplicative-benefits}

<!-- [ ] Establish central thesis about synergistic combination of three elements --> 
<!-- [ ] Include causal diagram visualizing how components interact --> 
<!-- [ ] Provide concrete examples of multiplicative effects across domains -->

The central thesis of this work is that combining three elements—automated worldview extraction, prediction market integration, and formal policy evaluation—creates multiplicative rather than merely additive benefits for AI governance. Each component enhances the others, creating a system more valuable than the sum of its parts.

**Automated worldview extraction** using frontier language models addresses the scaling bottleneck in current approaches to AI risk modeling. The Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project demonstrated the value of formal representation but required extensive manual effort to translate qualitative arguments into quantitative models. Automation enables processing orders of magnitude more content, incorporating diverse perspectives, and maintaining models in near real-time as new arguments emerge.

**Prediction market integration** grounds these models in collective forecasting intelligence. By connecting formal representations to live forecasting platforms, the system can incorporate timely judgments about critical uncertainties from calibrated forecasters. This creates a dynamic feedback loop, where models inform forecasters and forecasts update models.

**Formal policy evaluation** transforms static risk assessments into actionable guidance by modeling how specific interventions might alter critical parameters. This enables conditional forecasting—understanding not just the probability of adverse outcomes but how those probabilities change under different policy regimes.







### Thesis Structure and Roadmap {#sec-thesis-structure}

<!-- [ ] Preview the logical progression of the thesis --> 
<!-- [ ] Explain how each section builds on previous ones --> 
<!-- [ ] Provide reading guidance for different stakeholders -->

The remainder of this thesis develops the multiplicative benefits framework from theoretical foundations to practical implementation, following a progression from abstract principles to concrete applications:

Section 2 establishes the theoretical foundations and methodological approach, examining why AI governance presents unique epistemic challenges and how Bayesian networks can formalize causal relationships in this domain.

Section 3 presents the AMTAIR implementation, detailing the technical system that transforms qualitative arguments into formal representations. It demonstrates the approach through two case studies: the canonical Rain-Sprinkler-Lawn example and the more complex Carlsmith model of power-seeking AI.

Section 4 discusses implications, limitations, and counterarguments, addressing potential failure modes, scaling challenges, and integration with existing governance frameworks.

Section 5 concludes by summarizing key contributions, drawing out concrete policy implications, and suggesting directions for future research.

Throughout this progression, I maintain a dual focus on theoretical sophistication and practical utility. The framework aims not merely to advance academic understanding of AI risk but to provide actionable tools for improving coordination in AI governance.




























## Context & Background {#sec-context-background}









### Theoretical Foundations {#sec-theoretical-foundations}






#### AI Existential Risk: The Carlsmith Model {#sec-carlsmith-model}

<!-- [ ] Examine Joe Carlsmith's probabilistic model of power-seeking AI causing existential catastrophe --> 
<!-- [ ] Unpack the six key premises and explain why this structured approach serves as an ideal candidate for formal modeling -->

> Carlsmith's "Is power-seeking AI an existential risk?" (2021) represents one of the most structured approaches to assessing the probability of existential catastrophe from advanced AI. The analysis decomposes the overall risk into six key premises, each with an explicit probability estimate.

`The six key premises are:

1. Development of transformative AI systems this century (80%)
2. AI systems pursuing objectives in the world (95%)
3. Systems with power-seeking instrumental incentives (40%)
4. Systems with sufficient capability to pose existential threats (65%)
5. AI systems not aligned with human values (50%)
6. Misaligned, power-seeking systems causing existential catastrophe (65%)`






#### The Epistemic Challenge of Policy Evaluation {#sec-epistemic-challenge}

<!-- [ ] Explore why evaluating AI governance policies is particularly difficult: complex causal chains, deep uncertainty, divergent worldviews, and limited empirical data --> 
<!-- [ ] Establish why traditional policy analysis methods are insufficient -->

> AI governance policy evaluation faces unique epistemic challenges that render traditional policy analysis methods insufficient. The domain combines complex causal chains with limited empirical grounding, deep uncertainty about future capabilities, divergent stakeholder worldviews, and few opportunities for experimental testing before deployment.

`Traditional methods fall short in several ways:

- Cost-benefit analysis struggles with existential outcomes and deep uncertainty
- Scenario planning often lacks probabilistic reasoning necessary for rigorous evaluation
- Expert elicitation alone fails to formalize interdependencies between variables
- Qualitative approaches obscure crucial assumptions that drive conclusions`








#### Argument Mapping and Formal Representations {#sec-argument-mapping}

<!-- [ ] Bridge informal reasoning to formal models by showing how argument maps capture causal relationships and conditional dependencies that can be translated into Bayesian networks -->

> Argument mapping offers a bridge between informal reasoning in natural language and the formal representations needed for rigorous analysis. By explicitly identifying claims, premises, inferential relationships, and support/attack patterns, argument maps make implicit reasoning structures visible for examination and critique.

`The progression from natural language arguments to formal Bayesian networks requires an intermediate representation that preserves narrative structure while adding mathematical precision. The ArgDown format serves this purpose by encoding hierarchical relationships between statements, while its extension, BayesDown, adds probabilistic metadata to enable full Bayesian network construction.`

```
[Effect_Node]: Description of effect. {"instantiations": ["effect_TRUE", "effect_FALSE"]}
 + [Cause_Node]: Description of direct cause. {"instantiations": ["cause_TRUE", "cause_FALSE"]}
   + [Root_Cause]: Description of indirect cause. {"instantiations": ["root_TRUE", "root_FALSE"]}
```







#### Bayesian Networks as Knowledge Representation {#sec-bayesian-networks}

<!-- [ ] Introduce Bayesian networks as formal tools for representing uncertainty, causal relationships, and conditional dependencies --> 
<!-- [ ] Explain key concepts: nodes, edges, conditional probability tables, and inference -->

> Bayesian networks provide a formal mathematical framework for representing causal relationships and reasoning under uncertainty. These directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) combine qualitative structure—nodes representing variables and edges representing dependencies—with quantitative parameters in the form of conditional probability tables.

`Key properties that make Bayesian networks particularly suited to AI risk modeling include:

- Natural representation of causal relationships between variables
- Explicit handling of uncertainty through probability distributions
- Support for evidence updating through Bayesian inference
- Capability for interventional reasoning through do-calculus
- Balance between mathematical rigor and intuitive visual representation`

[![Example Bayesian Network](https://claude.ai/images/bayesian-network-example.png){#fig-bayesian-network fig-alt="A directed acyclic graph showing a simple Bayesian network with nodes and edges" fig-align="center" width="70%"}](https://claude.ai/chat/ab8988f3-18b7-45a5-8a50-b25aa4b34cbf)










#### The MTAIR Framework: Achievements and Limitations {#sec-mtair-framework}

<!-- [ ] Review the MTAIR project's approach to modeling AI risks using Analytica, highlighting both its innovations and limitations, particularly the manual labor intensity that limits scalability -->

> The Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project demonstrated the value of formal probabilistic modeling for AI safety, but also revealed significant limitations in the manual approach. While MTAIR successfully translated complex arguments into Bayesian networks and enabled sensitivity analysis, the intensive human labor required for model creation limited both scalability and timeliness.

`MTAIR's key innovations included:

- Explicit representation of uncertainty through probability distributions
- Structured decomposition of complex risk scenarios
- Integration of diverse expert judgments
- Sensitivity analysis to identify critical parameters

Its limitations motivated the current automated approach:

- Manual labor intensity limiting scalability
- Static nature of models once constructed
- Limited accessibility for non-technical stakeholders
- Challenges in representing multiple worldviews simultaneously`










#### "A Narrow Path": Conditional Policy Proposals in Practice {#sec-narrow-path}

<!-- [ ] Examine "A Narrow Path" as a case study of conditional policy proposals, highlighting how formal modeling could clarify the conditions under which specific policy interventions would be effective -->

> "A Narrow Path" represents an influential example of conditional policy proposals in AI governance—identifying interventions that could succeed under specific conditions rather than absolute prescriptions. However, these conditions remain implicitly defined and qualitatively described, limiting rigorous evaluation.

`Formal modeling could enhance such proposals by:

- Making conditions explicit and quantifiable
- Clarifying when interventions would be effective
- Identifying which uncertainties most significantly affect outcomes
- Enabling systematic comparison of alternative approaches
- Supporting robust policy development across possible futures`






























### Methodology {#sec-methodology}








#### Research Design Overview {#sec-research-design}

<!-- [ ] Present the overall research approach, combining theoretical development, software implementation, validation testing, and policy application --> 
<!-- [ ] Clarify the iterative nature of the process -->

> This research combines theoretical development with practical implementation, following an iterative approach that moves between conceptual refinement and technical validation. The methodology encompasses formal framework development, computational implementation, extraction quality assessment, and application to real-world AI governance questions.

`The research process follows four main phases:

1. Framework development: Creating the theoretical foundations and formal representations
2. System implementation: Building the computational tools for extraction and analysis
3. Validation testing: Assessing extraction quality and system performance
4. Application evaluation: Applying the framework to concrete AI governance questions`







#### Formalizing World Models from AI Safety Literature {#sec-formalizing-world-models}

<!-- [ ] Detail the process of extracting causal relationships, key variables, and probabilistic judgments from AI safety literature --> 
<!-- [ ] Explain the role of LLMs in this process and the development of prompt engineering techniques to improve extraction quality -->

> The core methodological challenge involves transforming natural language arguments in AI safety literature into formal causal models with explicit probability judgments. This extraction process identifies key variables, causal relationships, and both explicit and implicit probability estimates through a systematic pipeline.

`The extraction approach combines:

- Identification of key variables and entities in text
- Recognition of causal claims and relationships
- Detection of explicit and implicit probability judgments
- Transformation into structured intermediate representations
- Conversion to formal Bayesian networks

Large language models facilitate this process through:

- Two-stage prompting that separates structure from probability extraction
- Specialized templates for different types of source documents
- Techniques for identifying implicit assumptions and relationships
- Mechanisms for handling ambiguity and uncertainty`









#### Directed Acyclic Graphs: Structure and Semantics {#sec-directed-acyclic-graphs}

<!-- [ ] Explain the mathematical properties of DAGs and their semantic interpretation in the context of AI risk modeling --> 
<!-- [ ] Cover both structural and parametric aspects of the models -->

> Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) form the mathematical foundation of Bayesian networks, encoding both the qualitative structure of causal relationships and the quantitative parameters that define conditional dependencies. In AI risk modeling, these structures represent causal pathways to potential outcomes of interest.

`Key mathematical properties include:

- Acyclicity, ensuring no feedback loops
- Path properties defining information flow
- D-separation criteria determining conditional independence
- Markov blanket defining minimal contextual information

Semantic interpretation in AI risk contexts:

- Nodes represent key variables in risk pathways
- Edges represent causal or inferential relationships
- Path blocking corresponds to intervention points
- Probability flows represent risk propagation through systems`








#### Quantification Approaches for Probabilistic Judgments {#sec-quantification-approaches}

<!-- [ ] Examine methods for converting qualitative judgments into quantitative probabilities, including expert elicitation, calibration techniques, and sensitivity analysis --> 
<!-- [ ] Discuss challenges of aggregating diverse probabilistic judgments -->

> Transforming qualitative judgments in AI safety literature into quantitative probabilities requires a systematic approach to interpretation, extraction, and validation. This process combines direct extraction of explicit numerical statements with inference of implicit probability judgments from qualitative language.

`Quantification methods include:

- Direct extraction of explicit numerical statements
- Linguistic mapping of qualitative expressions
- Expert elicitation techniques for ambiguous cases
- Bayesian updating from multiple sources

Special challenges in AI risk quantification:

- Deep uncertainty about unprecedented events
- Diverse disciplinary languages and conventions
- Limited empirical basis for calibration
- Value-laden aspects of risk assessment`







#### Inference Techniques for Complex Networks {#sec-inference-techniques}

<!-- [ ] Review Monte Carlo sampling and other inference techniques for complex Bayesian networks, explaining their application to policy evaluation --> 
<!-- [ ] Discuss computational complexity considerations and approximation methods -->

> Once Bayesian networks are constructed, probabilistic inference enables reasoning about uncertainties, counterfactuals, and policy interventions. For the complex networks representing AI risks, computational approaches must balance accuracy with tractability.

`Inference methods implemented include:

- Exact methods for smaller networks (variable elimination, junction trees)
- Approximate methods for larger networks (Monte Carlo sampling)
- Specialized approaches for rare events
- Intervention modeling for policy evaluation

Implementation considerations include:

<!-- [ ] Detail methods for connecting the formal models with live data sources from prediction markets and forecasting platforms --> 
<!-- [ ] Explain data standardization, weighting mechanisms, and update procedures -->

> To maintain relevance in a rapidly evolving field, formal models must integrate with live data sources such as prediction markets and forecasting platforms. This integration enables continuous updating of model parameters as new information emerges.

`Integration approaches include:

- API connections to platforms like Metaculus
- Semantic mapping between forecast questions and model variables
- Weighting mechanisms based on forecaster track records
- Update procedures for incorporating new predictions
- Feedback loops identifying valuable forecast questions

Technical implementation involves:

- Standardized data formats across platforms
- Conflict resolution for contradictory sources
- Temporal alignment of forecasts
- Confidence-weighted aggregation methods`

<!-- [ ] Present the overall architecture of AMTAIR, showing how different components interact --> 
<!-- [ ] Explain the data pipeline from extraction through modeling to visualization and policy evaluation -->

> The AMTAIR system implements an end-to-end pipeline from unstructured text to interactive Bayesian network visualization. Its modular architecture comprises five main components that progressively transform information from natural language into formal models.

### Concluding Reflections {#sec-concluding-reflections}

<!-- [ ] Close with broader reflections on the role of formal modeling in addressing complex governance challenges, particularly under conditions of deep uncertainty and rapid technological change -->

> At its core, this work represents a bet that the epistemic challenges in AI governance are not merely incidental but structural—and that addressing them requires not just more conversation but better tools for collective sensemaking. The stakes of this bet could hardly be higher, as coordinating our response to increasingly powerful AI systems may well determine humanity's long-term future.

`AMTAIR contributes to this coordination challenge by:

- Making implicit models explicit
- Revealing genuine points of disagreement
- Enabling rigorous evaluation of interventions
- Supporting exploration across possible futures
- Creating common ground for diverse stakeholders

Ultimately, the project aims to transform how we think about AI governance—not by providing definitive answers, but by improving the quality of our questions, the rigor of our reasoning, and the clarity of our communication. In a domain characterized by deep uncertainty and rapid change, such epistemic foundations may be our most valuable resource.`
