# **Thesis Writing Journey Begins**

## **Abstract**

The coordination crisis in AI governance presents a paradoxical challenge: unprecedented investment in AI safety coexists alongside fundamental coordination failures across technical, policy, and ethical domains. These divisions systematically increase existential risk by creating safety gaps, misallocating resources, and fostering inconsistent approaches to interdependent problems. This thesis introduces AMTAIR (Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling), a computational approach that addresses this coordination failure by automating the extraction of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature using frontier language models.

The AMTAIR system implements an end-to-end pipeline that transforms unstructured text into interactive Bayesian networks through a novel two-stage extraction process: first capturing argument structure in ArgDown format, then enhancing it with probability information in BayesDown format. This approach bridges qualitative expert reasoning with quantitative analysis, making implicit models explicit and enabling rigorous evaluation of policy impacts. When applied to Joseph Carlsmith's model of existential risk from power-seeking AI, the system successfully formalizes complex causal relationships while preserving key narrative elements, revealing critical risk pathways and intervention opportunities.

By making implicit models explicit, enabling cross-worldview comparison, and supporting policy evaluation across diverse scenarios, the AMTAIR approach creates epistemic infrastructure that facilitates coordination between technical, governance, and ethical domains. This research offers both methodological innovations in automated knowledge extraction and practical tools for enhancing strategic coordination in AI governance—a critical contribution as capabilities continue to accelerate and the window for establishing effective governance narrows.

## **1\. Introduction**

### **1.1 The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance**

On March 22, 2023, over 1,000 AI researchers and technology leaders signed an open letter calling for a pause in advanced AI development, citing "profound risks to society and humanity." Within days, multiple counterstatements emerged—some arguing the risks were overstated, others that the proposed pause was insufficient, and still others that the entire framing misunderstood the problem. This fragmentation of response typifies what I call the coordination crisis in AI governance: despite unprecedented investment and growing awareness, we lack the strategic "operating system" needed to align disparate efforts as AI capabilities advance at an accelerating pace.

This coordination gap isn't merely inefficient—it systematically increases existential risk. When organizations function as independent processors without shared protocols, we generate duplicative work, leave critical gaps unaddressed, and create inconsistent approaches to interdependent problems. Technical alignment researchers develop solutions without implementation pathways; policy specialists craft frameworks without technical grounding; ethicists articulate principles without operational specificity. As capabilities approach human-level intelligence, this fragmentation becomes increasingly dangerous.

The empirical patterns defining this landscape reveal troubling trends. First, AI capabilities are advancing at an accelerating pace, with compression from decades to months between significant milestones and emergent capabilities appearing at scale thresholds. Second, technical alignment efforts face substantial challenges, including specification problems, robustness limitations, and interpretability bottlenecks. Third, AI governance efforts remain fragmented with proliferation without convergence, institutional silos, and competing jurisdictional claims. Finally, global coordination mechanisms have consistently struggled with analogous challenges from climate change to nuclear security to pandemic response, suggesting existing institutions are poorly suited to rapid technological development with distributed creation capability.

Historical parallels highlight the unique difficulties in the AI domain. Early nuclear governance relied on implicit coordination with devastating consequences; only after explicit mechanisms emerged—test ban treaties, verification protocols—did risks stabilize. Similarly, climate change coordination suffered decades of delay when lacking shared models and verification mechanisms. What distinguishes AI governance, however, is the compressed timeframe for action, the technical complexity requiring integration across disciplines, and the mixed competitive-cooperative incentives that create classic stag hunt dynamics with tragedy-of-the-commons characteristics.

This coordination crisis demands novel approaches to knowledge sharing and integration across domains. As capabilities accelerate and the window for establishing effective governance narrows, better tools for facilitating coordination become not merely beneficial but essential for managing what may be humanity's most consequential technological challenge.

### **1.2 Research Question and Scope**

This thesis addresses a specific aspect of the coordination crisis in AI governance through the central research question:

**How can frontier AI technologies be utilized to automate the extraction of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature, enabling robust prediction of policy impacts?**

To properly frame this investigation, I must clearly define the key components of this question:

**Frontier AI technologies** refers to the most capable large language models (LLMs) and related systems that demonstrate advanced capabilities in understanding and generating text, analyzing complex patterns, and performing structured transformations of information. These technologies serve both as the subject of governance concern and, in this research, as tools for addressing governance challenges.

**Automation** involves creating computational systems that can perform tasks previously requiring human expertise with minimal supervision, particularly the extraction of structured representations from unstructured text and the transformation of these representations into formal models.

**Probabilistic world models** are formalized representations of causal relationships and uncertainties that capture both the structure of arguments (which factors influence which outcomes) and quantitative judgments about likelihoods (how probable different scenarios are based on various conditions). These models make implicit reasoning explicit and enable rigorous analysis.

**Policy impacts** refers to the counterfactual effects of governance interventions on outcomes of interest, particularly the reduction of existential risk from advanced AI systems. Predicting these impacts involves modeling how changes in relevant factors (such as safety standards, development practices, or coordination mechanisms) affect the probabilities of different scenarios.

The scope of this research is carefully bounded in several important ways. First, it focuses specifically on existential risk from misaligned AI rather than attempting to address all AI governance challenges. Second, it examines automation of existing expert knowledge rather than generating novel risk assessments. Third, it prioritizes making implicit models explicit rather than advocating for particular governance positions. Finally, it emphasizes the extraction and representation of arguments rather than developing novel infrastructure for forecasting and prediction markets, though it enables integration with such systems.

This research sits at the intersection of several disciplines, drawing on technical AI alignment (for understanding risk factors), knowledge representation (for formal modeling approaches), and AI governance (for policy context and intervention options). It employs computational methods not as a replacement for human judgment but as tools to enhance the accessibility, precision, and integration of expert reasoning across domains. This hybrid approach acknowledges both the technical complexity of AI risk assessment and the inherently value-laden nature of governance decisions.

### **1.3 The Multiplicative Benefits Framework**

The approach developed in this thesis combines three complementary elements that, when integrated, create value that exceeds their individual contributions. This multiplicative benefits framework explains why the components must be developed together rather than separately:

First, **automated extraction** transforms unstructured expert knowledge into structured representations, making implicit models explicit and enabling rigorous analysis. While valuable on its own, extraction reaches its full potential when the resulting models are enhanced with probabilistic information and connected to live data sources. The extraction component addresses the key challenge of scaling up formalization beyond what manual approaches can achieve, using frontier LLMs to process the growing volume of AI safety literature.

Second, **prediction market integration** connects static models to dynamic data streams, ensuring that risk assessments remain current as new information emerges. This component bridges the gap between theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence, creating living models that evolve with the rapidly changing AI landscape. While prediction markets provide valuable information independently, their integration with formal causal models dramatically enhances their utility for understanding complex risk scenarios.

Third, **formal policy evaluation** enables rigorous assessment of governance interventions, testing how specific proposals might perform across different possible futures. This component transforms abstract policy discussions into concrete, quantifiable assessments of expected impact, helping governance stakeholders allocate resources to the most effective interventions. While policy analysis can be conducted without formal models, the ability to systematically evaluate interventions across diverse worldviews substantially improves analysis quality.

These components interact in synergistic ways illustrated by the causal diagram in Figure 1\. Automated extraction provides the foundation by transforming unstructured knowledge into formal models. These models then serve as the structure for integrating prediction market data, which updates the probability estimates. The enhanced models enable formal policy evaluation, which generates insights that inform both the models themselves and real-world governance decisions.

\[FIGURE 1: Causal diagram showing interactions between automated extraction, prediction market integration, and policy evaluation components\]

Consider a concrete example of these multiplicative benefits: when analyzing proposals for governance of compute resources, automated extraction might formalize expert perspectives on how compute access affects capability development and risk. Prediction market integration could then provide current estimates of key uncertainties like technological development timelines. Policy evaluation would use this enhanced model to compare different compute governance approaches across various scenarios, revealing which approaches remain robust despite uncertainty about future developments.

Without any one component, the system's value would be substantially diminished. Extraction without prediction markets would create static models that quickly become outdated. Prediction markets without formal causal models would provide isolated data points without coherent integration. Policy evaluation without automated extraction would be limited to a small set of manually created models, missing the diversity of expert perspectives. The full value emerges only when all components work together to create a comprehensive system for understanding and managing AI risk.

### **1.4 Thesis Structure and Roadmap**

This thesis proceeds through a structured progression designed to build a comprehensive understanding of both the coordination challenge and the proposed solution. Each section builds upon previous ones while addressing specific aspects of the research question.

In **Section 2: Background and Context**, I establish the theoretical and practical foundations for the research. First, I introduce Carlsmith's model of existential risk from power-seeking AI, explaining its structured approach to quantifying risk through six key premises. Then I examine Bayesian networks as a knowledge representation framework, using the canonical rain-sprinkler-lawn example to illustrate fundamental concepts. Next, I analyze the unique epistemic challenges in policy evaluation for AI governance, explaining why traditional approaches fall short. Finally, I explore argument mapping and formal representations as bridges between qualitative reasoning and quantitative models, introducing the ArgDown and BayesDown formats.

**Section 3: Own Position and Argument** presents the AMTAIR approach as a solution to the coordination crisis. I explain the system architecture, with particular focus on the two-stage extraction process that separates structure from probability. I then explore BayesDown as a hybrid representation bridging qualitative and quantitative aspects. Next, I discuss the interactive visualization approach that makes complex models accessible to diverse stakeholders. Finally, I outline how the system enables policy evaluation through counterfactual analysis and intervention modeling.

In **Section 4: Implementation**, I detail the technical realization of the AMTAIR approach. Beginning with the system architecture and data flow, I explain how components interact to transform text into interactive models. I then demonstrate the complete pipeline using the canonical rain-sprinkler-lawn example, walking through each stage of the process with code examples and visualizations. Next, I apply the system to Carlsmith's model, showing how a complex real-world risk assessment can be formalized and analyzed. Finally, I present performance metrics and validation results demonstrating the system's capabilities and limitations.

**Section 5: Analysis and Results** examines insights gained from applying the AMTAIR approach to Carlsmith's model. I analyze structural properties of the formalized model, including centrality measures and critical pathways. I then perform sensitivity analysis to identify the most influential parameters affecting risk estimates. Next, I demonstrate policy impact evaluation by modeling specific interventions and assessing their effects across scenarios. Finally, I discuss cross-domain integration potential, examining how the approach can connect technical, governance, and ethical domains.

In **Section 6: Counterclaims and Rebuttals**, I address potential objections to the AMTAIR approach. I examine limitations of formalization, concerns about epistemic humility, democratic governance considerations, and implementation feasibility challenges. For each objection, I present supporting evidence, offer a rebuttal, and suggest a synthesis that acknowledges the valid concerns while demonstrating how the approach addresses them.

**Section 7: Conclusion and Outlook** summarizes key contributions, acknowledges limitations, and explores future research directions. I recap methodological innovations, technical achievements, and analytical insights before discussing remaining challenges. I then outline promising extensions to the system and suggest broader applications. Finally, I reflect on implications for AI governance, discussing how formal modeling can enhance epistemics, facilitate coordination, and inform strategic planning.

The thesis includes comprehensive **References** and **Appendices** with technical details, syntax specifications, complete analysis results, and additional case studies.

Readers with technical backgrounds may wish to focus initially on Sections 4 and 5, which provide detailed implementation information and results. Those primarily interested in AI governance may find Sections 3 and 6 most relevant to policy considerations. For readers new to the topic, following the sections in sequence will build a progressive understanding from foundational concepts to specific applications and implications.

## **2\. Background and Context**

### **2.1 AI Existential Risk: The Carlsmith Model**

Joseph Carlsmith's "Is Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk?" represents one of the most structured attempts to assess the probability of existential catastrophe from advanced AI systems. Rather than relying on intuition or general concerns, Carlsmith approaches the question by breaking it down into six key premises with explicitly estimated probabilities. This decomposition makes his model an ideal candidate for formalization, as it already exhibits a structure amenable to Bayesian network representation.

Carlsmith's six key premises, each with his probability estimates, are:

1. **Transformative AI this century (80%)**: "By 2100, humans will develop AI systems that can perform almost all economically relevant human cognitive labor much more cheaply than humans."

2. **AI systems pursuing objectives (95%)**: "If we develop TAI systems, we will build and deploy systems that pursue objectives in the world."

3. **Systems with power-seeking incentives (40%)**: "Some of these systems will have objectives and capabilities that create strong incentives for power-seeking behavior."

4. **Systems with sufficient capability for existential threat (65%)**: "Power-seeking systems of this kind will have strong capability advantages over humans."

5. **Misaligned systems (50%)**: "Some of these systems will be goal-misaligned with the continued existence of humans."

6. **Misaligned power-seeking systems causing catastrophe (65%)**: "Efforts to create aligned and safe systems will fall short in critical cases."

By multiplying these probabilities (with some adjustments for dependencies), Carlsmith arrives at an approximately 5% probability of existential catastrophe from power-seeking AI. This estimate represents his considered judgment after extensive research and consultation with domain experts.

What makes Carlsmith's model particularly valuable for formal representation is not just its explicit probabilities, but its clearly articulated causal structure. He describes how these premises connect and influence one another, creating a framework that naturally translates into a Bayesian network. For example, he explains how the difficulty of alignment influences the likelihood of misaligned systems, and how various factors might enable or prevent catastrophic outcomes from misaligned systems.

The model goes beyond these six premises to explore additional factors. Carlsmith discusses how instrumental convergence, problems with proxies, and problems with search processes contribute to the difficulty of alignment. He examines how warning shots, rapid capability escalation, and corrective feedback affect the likelihood of societal responses. He considers incentives to deploy potentially dangerous systems and deception by AI systems as important factors in deployment decisions.

Figure 2 shows a simplified diagram of Carlsmith's model, highlighting the key causal relationships between factors.

\[FIGURE 2: Simplified diagram of Carlsmith's model showing causal relationships between key factors\]

\# Simple code to calculate Carlsmith's bottom-line probability  
p\_transformative\_ai \= 0.8  
p\_objective\_pursuit \= 0.95  
p\_power\_seeking \= 0.4  
p\_capability\_advantage \= 0.65  
p\_misalignment \= 0.5  
p\_catastrophe\_given\_all\_above \= 0.65

\# Simplified calculation (ignoring some dependencies)  
p\_doom \= (p\_transformative\_ai \* p\_objective\_pursuit \* p\_power\_seeking \*   
          p\_capability\_advantage \* p\_misalignment \* p\_catastrophe\_given\_all\_above)

print(f"Estimated probability of existential catastrophe: {p\_doom:.3f} or about {p\_doom\*100:.1f}%")

While this calculation provides a useful starting point, it simplifies important dependencies between the factors. For example, the likelihood of catastrophe given misaligned power-seeking systems is not independent of the capability advantage those systems have. A more sophisticated model needs to represent these conditional dependencies explicitly—precisely what a Bayesian network approach enables.

Carlsmith's model provides an ideal case study for the AMTAIR approach for several reasons. First, it contains explicit probability estimates that can be captured in a formal representation. Second, it has a clear causal structure linking various factors that contribute to risk. Third, it encompasses a wide range of considerations from technical alignment to governance factors, making it relevant across domains. Finally, its structure is complex enough to demonstrate the value of formalization while remaining tractable for analysis.

By formalizing Carlsmith's model, we can not only preserve his original analysis but enhance it through structural examination, sensitivity analysis, and policy evaluation—tasks that become possible once the implicit model is made explicit through computational representation.

### **2.2 Bayesian Networks as Knowledge Representation**

Bayesian networks provide a powerful framework for representing and reasoning about uncertain knowledge, making them particularly suitable for modeling complex domains like AI risk. A Bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

Formally, a Bayesian network consists of:

1. A set of variables {X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ} representing different aspects of the domain  
2. A directed acyclic graph where nodes represent variables and edges represent direct dependencies  
3. A conditional probability distribution P(Xᵢ|Parents(Xᵢ)) for each variable Xᵢ

The network structure encodes conditional independence assumptions: each variable Xᵢ is conditionally independent of its non-descendants given its parents in the graph. This property enables compact representation of joint probability distributions, which would otherwise require exponentially many parameters.

The canonical "Rain-Sprinkler-Lawn" example illustrates these concepts simply but effectively. Consider a scenario with three binary variables:

* Rain (R): Whether it is raining (TRUE/FALSE)  
* Sprinkler (S): Whether the sprinkler is on (TRUE/FALSE)  
* Grass\_Wet (W): Whether the grass is wet (TRUE/FALSE)

Both rain and the sprinkler can cause the grass to be wet, and rain also influences whether the sprinkler is on (people typically don't use sprinklers when it's raining). Figure 3 shows this network structure.

\[FIGURE 3: Diagram of the Rain-Sprinkler-Lawn Bayesian network showing Rain influencing both Sprinkler and Grass\_Wet, and Sprinkler influencing Grass\_Wet\]

For each node, we specify a conditional probability table (CPT) defining the probability distribution over its possible values, conditioned on all possible combinations of its parent values. For example:

* P(R=TRUE) \= 0.2, P(R=FALSE) \= 0.8 (prior probability of rain)  
* P(S=TRUE|R=TRUE) \= 0.01, P(S=TRUE|R=FALSE) \= 0.4 (conditional probability of sprinkler given rain)  
* P(W=TRUE|R=TRUE,S=TRUE) \= 0.99, P(W=TRUE|R=TRUE,S=FALSE) \= 0.8, etc. (conditional probability of wet grass given rain and sprinkler)

With this representation, we can compute the probability of any combination of variable values or answer queries about conditional probabilities. For example, we can calculate the probability that it was raining given that the grass is wet, P(R=TRUE|W=TRUE), using Bayes' rule and the conditional probabilities in the network.

Bayesian networks offer several advantages for modeling AI risk:

1. **Causal interpretation:** The directed edges represent causal influences, aligning with our natural understanding of how factors affect outcomes.

2. **Uncertainty representation:** They explicitly represent probability distributions, capturing the inherent uncertainty in complex domains.

3. **Modular structure:** New variables and relationships can be added without rebuilding the entire model, enabling incremental refinement.

4. **Inference capability:** They support various types of queries, including prediction (what will happen given current conditions?), diagnosis (what might have caused observed outcomes?), and intervention (what if we change something?).

5. **Transparency:** The structure and parameters are explicitly defined, making assumptions and judgments transparent for critique and refinement.

Perhaps most importantly, Bayesian networks align with how human experts often think about complex problems: identifying key factors, understanding how they influence each other, and making judgments about likelihoods under different conditions. This makes them well-suited for representing expert knowledge in a format that supports both human understanding and computational analysis.

The Rain-Sprinkler-Lawn example, while simple, illustrates the core concepts we'll apply to much more complex domains like AI risk. The same principles of identifying variables, specifying their relationships, and quantifying conditional probabilities extend naturally to models with dozens or hundreds of variables representing the many factors that influence existential risk from advanced AI systems.

### **2.3 The Epistemic Challenge of Policy Evaluation**

Evaluating policy interventions for AI governance presents unique epistemic challenges that traditional policy analysis methods struggle to address. These challenges arise from the complex causal chains, deep uncertainty, divergent worldviews, and limited empirical grounding that characterize the domain.

Traditional policy analysis relies heavily on historical precedent, empirical data, and established causal models. Cost-benefit analysis quantifies the predicted impacts of interventions based on observed relationships between variables. Scenario planning explores different futures but typically lacks probability estimates. Expert elicitation captures specialist knowledge but often fails to systematically represent interdependencies between factors. None of these approaches fully addresses the specific challenges of AI governance policy evaluation.

Four unique difficulties define the epistemic landscape of AI governance:

First, **complex causal chains with limited empirical grounding** characterize the relationship between governance interventions and risk outcomes. Unlike domains like public health, where interventions have measurable effects on well-defined outcomes, AI governance involves extended causal chains where actions today might influence technological development paths, institutional behaviors, and ultimately risk profiles decades in the future. These chains cannot be empirically tested through traditional methods, yet understanding them is essential for effective governance.

Second, **deep uncertainty about future capability development** creates a challenging environment for prediction. While some aspects of technology evolution follow discernible patterns, transformative capabilities often emerge unexpectedly through conceptual breakthroughs. This uncertainty isn't merely quantitative (what are the error bars on our predictions?) but qualitative (what kinds of capabilities might emerge?), creating fundamental challenges for traditional forecasting methods that rely on extrapolation from past trends.

Third, **divergent worldviews about fundamental risk factors** complicate consensus-building around governance approaches. Experts disagree not just about probability estimates but about which factors matter most and how they relate causally. Some emphasize technical alignment challenges, others focus on competitive dynamics between developers, and still others prioritize institutional oversight mechanisms. Each worldview implies different intervention priorities, yet traditional policy analysis lacks tools for systematically comparing perspectives.

Fourth, **limited opportunities for experimental testing** prevent iterative refinement of governance approaches. Unlike domains where small-scale pilots can test intervention efficacy before wider implementation, many AI governance interventions must be designed without the benefit of experimental evidence. If certain risks materialize only once systems reach advanced capabilities, learning from experience comes too late.

Addressing these challenges requires explicit representation across multiple dimensions:

* **Uncertainty across multiple parameters:** The approach must represent not just uncertainty about outcomes but uncertainty about the relationships between variables and the structure of the causal model itself.

* **Conditional dependencies between variables:** The system needs to capture how different factors influence each other, enabling understanding of complex chains of causation from interventions to outcomes.

* **Comparable representation of different worldviews:** To facilitate productive discourse across perspectives, the approach must represent diverse causal models in a common framework that highlights both agreements and disagreements.

* **Continuous evidence integration mechanisms:** As new information emerges—from theoretical insights, empirical observations, or expert judgments—the system should update its representations to reflect current knowledge.

Historical analogues provide partial insights but no complete template. Nuclear governance established verification protocols and international monitoring, but over a longer timeframe than likely available for AI. Pandemic response developed early warning systems and response protocols, but struggles with similar challenges in predicting novel pathogen emergence. Climate governance demonstrates the difficulty of establishing effective international coordination mechanisms for slow-moving, high-impact risks.

What distinguishes AI governance is the combination of accelerating technological development, distributed creation capability, and potentially irreversible consequences once certain thresholds are crossed. This unique profile necessitates novel approaches to policy evaluation that can handle the epistemic challenges described above while providing actionable insights for governance.

The formal modeling approach developed in this thesis addresses these challenges by making assumptions explicit, facilitating structured comparison of worldviews, and enabling rigorous exploration of intervention impacts across scenarios. By transforming implicit models into explicit representations, it creates a foundation for more productive discourse about governance priorities and approaches, even amid deep uncertainty about future developments.

### **2.4 Argument Mapping and Formal Representations**

Argument mapping provides a bridge between natural language reasoning and formal probabilistic models, enabling the transformation of complex qualitative arguments into structured representations suitable for computational analysis. This section explores two key intermediate representations—ArgDown and BayesDown—that facilitate this transformation process.

Argument maps are structured visualizations that represent the logical relationships between claims, evidence, and objections. Unlike free-form text, they make explicit how different statements support or challenge one another, forcing clarity about the logical structure of arguments. Traditional argument maps typically include:

* Statements (claims, premises, conclusions) presented as nodes  
* Support and attack relationships shown as arrows between nodes  
* Hierarchical organization reflecting logical dependencies

These visualizations help identify unstated assumptions, circular reasoning, and gaps in argumentation. However, traditional argument mapping has limited expressivity for representing uncertainty—a crucial element in complex domains like AI risk assessment.

ArgDown extends the concept of argument mapping into a structured text format with a consistent syntax. Developed by Christian Voigt at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, ArgDown provides a markdown-like notation for representing arguments in a hierarchical structure that can be automatically visualized and analyzed. The basic syntax is:

\[Statement\]: Description of the statement.  
 \+ \[Supporting\_Statement\]: Description of supporting statement.  
   \+ \[Further\_Support\]: Description of additional support.  
 \- \[Opposing\_Statement\]: Description of opposing statement.

For the AMTAIR project, we adapt ArgDown to focus on causal relationships rather than general argumentation, using a modified syntax where the hierarchical structure represents causal influence:

\[Effect\]: Description of effect. {"instantiations": \["effect\_TRUE", "effect\_FALSE"\]}  
 \+ \[Cause1\]: Description of first cause. {"instantiations": \["cause1\_TRUE", "cause1\_FALSE"\]}  
 \+ \[Cause2\]: Description of second cause. {"instantiations": \["cause2\_TRUE", "cause2\_FALSE"\]}  
   \+ \[Root\_Cause\]: A cause that influences Cause2. {"instantiations": \["root\_TRUE", "root\_FALSE"\]}

This adaptation adds metadata in JSON format to specify possible states (instantiations) of each variable, preparing the structure for probabilistic enhancement. The hierarchical relationships (indented with plus signs) represent causal influence, creating a directed graph structure.

The Rain-Sprinkler-Lawn example in ArgDown format illustrates this structure:

\[Grass\_Wet\]: Concentrated moisture on, between and around the blades of grass. {"instantiations": \["grass\_wet\_TRUE", "grass\_wet\_FALSE"\]}  
 \+ \[Rain\]: Tears of angles crying high up in the skies hitting the ground. {"instantiations": \["rain\_TRUE", "rain\_FALSE"\]}  
 \+ \[Sprinkler\]: Activation of a centrifugal force based CO2 droplet distribution system. {"instantiations": \["sprinkler\_TRUE", "sprinkler\_FALSE"\]}  
   \+ \[Rain\]

This representation captures the causal structure (both Rain and Sprinkler influence Grass\_Wet, and Rain also influences Sprinkler) and specifies the possible states of each variable. However, it lacks probability information, which is where BayesDown extends the representation.

BayesDown builds on ArgDown by adding probability metadata, transforming a purely structural representation into a complete Bayesian network specification. The enhanced format includes:

\[Node\]: Description. {  
  "instantiations": \["node\_TRUE", "node\_FALSE"\],  
  "priors": {  
    "p(node\_TRUE)": "0.7",  
    "p(node\_FALSE)": "0.3"  
  },  
  "posteriors": {  
    "p(node\_TRUE|parent\_TRUE)": "0.9",  
    "p(node\_TRUE|parent\_FALSE)": "0.4",  
    "p(node\_FALSE|parent\_TRUE)": "0.1",  
    "p(node\_FALSE|parent\_FALSE)": "0.6"  
  }  
}

The Rain-Sprinkler-Lawn example in BayesDown format illustrates this enhancement:

\[Grass\_Wet\]: Concentrated moisture on grass. {  
  "instantiations": \["grass\_wet\_TRUE", "grass\_wet\_FALSE"\],  
  "priors": {"p(grass\_wet\_TRUE)": "0.322", "p(grass\_wet\_FALSE)": "0.678"},  
  "posteriors": {  
    "p(grass\_wet\_TRUE|sprinkler\_TRUE,rain\_TRUE)": "0.99",  
    "p(grass\_wet\_TRUE|sprinkler\_TRUE,rain\_FALSE)": "0.9",  
    "p(grass\_wet\_TRUE|sprinkler\_FALSE,rain\_TRUE)": "0.8",  
    "p(grass\_wet\_TRUE|sprinkler\_FALSE,rain\_FALSE)": "0.0"  
  }  
}  
 \+ \[Rain\]: Water falling from the sky. {  
   "instantiations": \["rain\_TRUE", "rain\_FALSE"\],  
   "priors": {"p(rain\_TRUE)": "0.2", "p(rain\_FALSE)": "0.8"}  
 }  
 \+ \[Sprinkler\]: Artificial watering system. {  
   "instantiations": \["sprinkler\_TRUE", "sprinkler\_FALSE"\],  
   "priors": {"p(sprinkler\_TRUE)": "0.44838", "p(sprinkler\_FALSE)": "0.55162"},  
   "posteriors": {  
     "p(sprinkler\_TRUE|rain\_TRUE)": "0.01",   
     "p(sprinkler\_TRUE|rain\_FALSE)": "0.4"  
   }  
 }  
   \+ \[Rain\]

This representation now contains all the information needed to construct a complete Bayesian network: variables with their possible states, causal relationships between variables, prior probabilities for root nodes, and conditional probability tables for nodes with parents.

The transformation workflow from natural language to BayesDown involves several steps:

1. Identify key variables and their possible states from the text  
2. Determine causal relationships between variables  
3. Represent the structure in ArgDown format  
4. Generate probability questions based on the structure  
5. Answer these questions (manually or via LLM)  
6. Incorporate probability answers into BayesDown format

This progressive transformation preserves the narrative richness of the original text while adding formal structure. The intermediate representations (ArgDown and BayesDown) remain human-readable, maintaining the connection to the original arguments while enabling computational analysis.

The key innovation in this approach is the separation of structure extraction from probability quantification, which aligns with how experts typically approach complex arguments. First, they identify what factors matter and how they relate causally, then they consider how probable different scenarios are based on those relationships. This two-stage process makes the extraction more robust and the resulting representations more interpretable.

### **2.5 The MTAIR Framework: Achievements and Limitations**

The Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project, led by David Manheim and colleagues, represents a significant precursor to the current research. Launched in 2021, MTAIR aimed to create structured representations of existential risks from advanced AI using Bayesian networks, directed acyclic graphs, and probabilistic modeling. Understanding its achievements and limitations provides important context for the current AMTAIR approach.

MTAIR emerged from the recognition that AI risk discussions often involved complex causal arguments with implicit probability judgments that were difficult to compare or integrate. By formalizing these arguments in structured models, the project sought to make assumptions explicit, enable quantitative analysis, and facilitate more productive discourse across different perspectives on AI risk.

The framework's key innovations included:

1. **Explicit representation of uncertainty through probability distributions:** Rather than presenting point estimates, MTAIR captured uncertainty about parameters using distributions, acknowledging the significant uncertainty in AI risk assessment.

2. **Hierarchical structure for complex scenarios:** The approach used nested models that allowed exploration of different levels of detail, from high-level risk factors to specific technical mechanisms.

3. **Integration of diverse expert judgments:** The framework incorporated perspectives from various specialists, creating a more comprehensive view than any single expert could provide.

4. **Sensitivity analysis methodology:** MTAIR developed techniques for identifying which parameters most significantly affected risk estimates, helping prioritize research efforts.

The project's practical impact extended beyond its technical achievements. It influenced research prioritization by identifying critical uncertainties that warranted further investigation. It enhanced discourse quality by providing a shared vocabulary and structure for discussing causal pathways to risk. It also created visual representations that made complex arguments more accessible to stakeholders without technical backgrounds.

Despite these achievements, MTAIR faced several important limitations:

1. **Manual labor intensity limiting scalability:** Creating and updating models required substantial expert time, limiting the number and complexity of models that could be developed and maintained. As one team member noted, "It often took several days of work to formalize even relatively straightforward arguments."

2. **Static nature of models once constructed:** The models were essentially snapshots that did not automatically update as new information emerged, requiring manual revision to remain current.

3. **Limited accessibility for non-technical stakeholders:** While visual representations improved accessibility, understanding and interacting with the models still required specialized knowledge.

4. **Challenges in representing multiple worldviews simultaneously:** Comparing different perspectives required creating separate models, making it difficult to identify specific points of agreement and disagreement.

These limitations motivate the current research in automating the extraction and transformation process. As AI capabilities advance and the volume of relevant research grows, manual approaches cannot keep pace with the need for comprehensive, up-to-date models. Automation addresses the scalability limitation by dramatically reducing the time required to create formal representations of expert arguments.

Moreover, incorporating frontier LLMs into the pipeline enables new capabilities that were not feasible in the original MTAIR framework. These include:

1. Processing larger volumes of literature to capture more diverse perspectives  
2. Generating intermediate representations that preserve narrative structure  
3. Automating the creation of probability questions based on model structure  
4. Facilitating integration with live data sources for continuous updates

By building on MTAIR's foundation while addressing its key limitations, the current research maintains continuity with established approaches to AI risk modeling while pushing the boundaries of what's possible through automation and enhanced representation formats.

The evolution from MTAIR to AMTAIR represents a natural progression: as the field matures and the challenges become more pressing, more sophisticated tools are needed to facilitate coordination and decision-making. Automation doesn't replace expert judgment but amplifies it, allowing insights to be captured, formalized, and shared more efficiently across the AI governance community.

## **3\. Own Position and Argument**

### **3.1 The AMTAIR Solution: Automation and Integration**

The coordination crisis in AI governance isn't merely a communication problem—it's a fundamental information processing challenge that scales with the complexity of the domain. As AI capabilities advance and research proliferates, even the most diligent experts cannot manually process, integrate, and analyze the growing volume of specialized knowledge. We need computational tools that augment human capabilities, much as telescopes extend our vision beyond natural limits.

AMTAIR—Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling—represents such a tool. It builds upon the MTAIR framework's conceptual foundation while addressing its core limitations through automation and integration. The approach doesn't replace human judgment but amplifies it, scaling up our collective ability to make implicit models explicit and enabling more rigorous evaluation of governance options.

The system architecture implements a five-stage pipeline that transforms unstructured text into interactive, analyzable models:

1. **Text ingestion and preprocessing:** Source documents enter the system, undergo normalization to handle diverse formats, and are stored with citation information preserved.

2. **LLM-powered extraction:** Documents are analyzed using a two-stage process that first identifies key variables and relationships (represented in ArgDown), then extracts probability information (represented in BayesDown).

3. **Bayesian network construction:** BayesDown representations are transformed into formal Bayesian networks with nodes, edges, and conditional probability tables.

4. **Interactive visualization:** The networks are rendered as interactive visualizations that encode probability information through color and provide progressive disclosure of details.

5. **Analysis and inference:** The system enables sensitivity analysis, intervention modeling, and comparison across worldviews.

What distinguishes AMTAIR from previous approaches is the central role of frontier language models in automating the extraction and transformation processes. Rather than treating these models as black boxes that generate answers, AMTAIR employs them as cognitive partners in a structured workflow, using carefully designed prompts to extract specific types of information and transform it between representations.

Consider how this approach differs from traditional methods of knowledge integration. Typically, synthesizing expert perspectives involves reading papers, taking notes, and mentally constructing a composite view—a process limited by individual cognitive capacity and vulnerable to various biases. AMTAIR externalizes this process, making each step explicit and reproducible. The LLM doesn't determine what's important; it helps transform expert knowledge into structured formats that humans can more easily analyze and compare.

The system's primary innovations lie in three areas:

First, the **two-stage extraction process** separates structural understanding from probability estimation, mirroring how humans typically approach complex arguments. This separation improves extraction quality by focusing LLMs on distinct cognitive tasks and creates interpretable intermediate representations.

Second, the **BayesDown representation format** bridges qualitative and quantitative aspects of arguments, maintaining narrative context while enabling mathematical precision. This hybrid format preserves the connection to original texts while supporting computational analysis.

Third, the **interactive visualization approach** makes complex probabilistic models accessible to non-technical stakeholders through intuitive visual encoding and progressive disclosure of information. This enhances cross-domain communication by creating shared reference points.

These innovations address specific limitations of the MTAIR framework. Where MTAIR required days of expert time to formalize arguments, AMTAIR can process papers in minutes. Where MTAIR created static snapshots, AMTAIR enables dynamic updating through integration with forecasting platforms. Where MTAIR struggled with accessibility, AMTAIR provides intuitive visualizations with multiple levels of detail.

The potential impact extends beyond technical achievements. By making implicit models explicit, AMTAIR helps identify genuine disagreements versus terminological confusion. By enabling systematic comparison across worldviews, it facilitates more productive discourse about risk factors and interventions. By supporting counterfactual analysis, it allows policymakers to evaluate governance options across diverse scenarios.

This isn't to suggest that computational tools alone can solve the coordination crisis. Human judgment remains essential for interpreting results, contextualizing insights, and making value-laden decisions. But tools like AMTAIR can dramatically enhance our collective ability to process complex information, identify patterns, and evaluate options—capabilities that become increasingly crucial as AI systems grow more powerful and the stakes of governance decisions rise.

### **3.2 The Two-Stage Extraction Process**

The heart of the AMTAIR approach lies in its two-stage extraction process, which transforms unstructured text into structured probabilistic models through distinct steps that mirror human cognitive processes. This separation—extracting structure before probability—creates important advantages for automation quality, intermediate verification, and interpretability.

When humans analyze complex arguments, they typically first determine what factors matter and how they relate causally, then assess how likely different scenarios are based on those relationships. A climate scientist reading a paper first identifies key variables (emissions, warming, effects) and their causal connections before estimating probabilities of outcomes. This natural cognitive sequence inspired AMTAIR's two-stage approach.

**Stage 1: Structure Extraction** focuses on identifying key variables and their causal relationships from text, transforming unstructured arguments into ArgDown format. This process involves:

1. **Variable identification:** Determining the key factors discussed in the text, including their possible states (e.g., whether a factor is present/absent or has multiple levels)

2. **Relationship mapping:** Establishing how variables influence each other, creating a directed graph of causal connections

3. **Hierarchical organization:** Arranging variables according to their causal relationships, from root causes to final effects

4. **Metadata attachment:** Annotating each variable with its description and possible states in structured JSON format

The LLM prompt for this stage emphasizes clear identification of causal structure without requiring probability judgments, allowing the model to focus entirely on understanding "what affects what" in the text. This specialized prompt includes detailed instructions about ArgDown syntax, examples of well-formed representations, and guidance for preserving the author's intended meaning.

Figure 4 shows a sample of the ArgDown extraction for Carlsmith's model, illustrating how complex qualitative arguments are transformed into structured representations:

\[FIGURE 4: Sample ArgDown extraction from Carlsmith's paper showing hierarchical structure of variables related to existential risk\]

def parse\_markdown\_hierarchy\_fixed(markdown\_text, ArgDown=True):  
    """  
    Parse ArgDown format into a structured DataFrame with parent-child relationships.

    Args:  
        markdown\_text (str): Text in ArgDown format  
        ArgDown (bool): If True, extracts only structure without probabilities  
                       If False, extracts both structure and probability information

    Returns:  
        pandas.DataFrame: Structured data with node information, relationships, and attributes  
    """  
    \# Clean and prepare the text  
    clean\_text \= remove\_comments(markdown\_text)

    \# Extract basic information about nodes  
    titles\_info \= extract\_titles\_info(clean\_text)

    \# Determine hierarchical relationships  
    titles\_with\_relations \= establish\_relationships\_fixed(titles\_info, clean\_text)

    \# Convert to structured DataFrame format  
    df \= convert\_to\_dataframe(titles\_with\_relations, ArgDown)

    \# Add derived columns for analysis  
    df \= add\_no\_parent\_no\_child\_columns\_to\_df(df)  
    df \= add\_parents\_instantiation\_columns\_to\_df(df)

    return df

This key function transforms the ArgDown text into a structured DataFrame, capturing the hierarchical relationships between variables and preparing them for further processing. The function works by identifying node titles, descriptions, and indentation levels, then establishing parent-child relationships based on the hierarchy indicated by indentation.

**Stage 2: Probability Integration** enhances the structural representation with probability information, creating a complete BayesDown specification. This stage involves:

1. **Question generation:** Automatically creating appropriate probability questions based on the network structure

2. **Probability extraction:** Obtaining probability estimates for each question, either from the text or through LLM inference

3. **Consistency checking:** Ensuring probability distributions sum to 1 and match structural constraints

4. **BayesDown integration:** Incorporating probability information into the ArgDown structure

The key innovation in this stage is the automated generation of appropriate probability questions based on network structure. For each node, the system generates questions about prior probabilities (how likely is this variable in isolation?) and conditional probabilities (how likely is this variable given different states of its parents?).

Figure 5 illustrates how probability questions are derived for a simple node with one parent:

\[FIGURE 5: Diagram showing how probability questions are generated based on network structure\]

For the "Sprinkler" node with parent "Rain," the system automatically generates questions like:

* What is the probability for Sprinkler=sprinkler\_TRUE?  
* What is the probability for Sprinkler=sprinkler\_TRUE if Rain=rain\_TRUE?  
* What is the probability for Sprinkler=sprinkler\_TRUE if Rain=rain\_FALSE?

These questions are then answered either by extracting explicit probabilities from the text or by having the LLM infer reasonable values based on the author's arguments. The answers are structured into a complete BayesDown representation that includes both the causal structure and all necessary probability information.

The visualization below demonstrates the completed extraction for a portion of Carlsmith's model, showing how variables like "Misaligned Power Seeking" are influenced by multiple factors, each with associated probabilities:

\[VISUALIZATION: Extracted causal structure from Carlsmith's model with probability information\]

This two-stage approach offers several important advantages:

1. **Improved extraction quality:** By focusing on one cognitive task at a time, the LLM performs better at each stage than it would attempting to extract everything simultaneously.

2. **Intermediate verification:** Having ArgDown as an intermediate representation allows human verification before probability extraction, catching structural errors early.

3. **Separation of concerns:** Structure and probability can be updated independently, enabling more flexible maintenance as new information emerges.

4. **Alignment with human cognition:** The process mirrors how experts approach complex arguments, making the system's operation more intuitive and interpretable.

Perhaps most importantly, the intermediate ArgDown representation creates a bridge between qualitative and quantitative aspects of arguments. It preserves the narrative structure and conceptual relationships from the original text while preparing for mathematical precision through probability integration. This hybrid approach maintains the strengths of both worlds: the richness of natural language and the rigor of formal models.

### **3.3 BayesDown: Bridging Qualitative and Quantitative Representation**

If the coordination crisis in AI governance stems partly from incompatible languages across domains—technical researchers speaking in mathematical formalisms, policy specialists in institutional frameworks, and ethicists in normative concepts—then effective coordination requires bridges between these domains. BayesDown serves as such a bridge, combining the narrative richness of qualitative argumentation with the precision of quantitative probability judgments.

Traditional formal representations face a fundamental tradeoff: increase precision and you sacrifice accessibility; enhance accessibility and you lose precision. Mathematical notations offer exactness but exclude many stakeholders. Natural language provides accessibility but permits ambiguity and vagueness. This tradeoff creates communication barriers between technical and policy domains, limiting coordination on complex challenges like AI governance.

BayesDown disrupts this tradeoff by creating a hybrid representation that preserves strengths from both worlds. Its design follows three key principles:

First, **human readability** ensures the representation remains interpretable without specialized training. The syntax builds on familiar conventions from markdown and JSON, maintaining hierarchical relationships through indentation and encapsulating technical details within structured metadata. Unlike purely mathematical notations, the format preserves natural language descriptions alongside formal elements.

Second, **machine processability** enables computational analysis and transformation. The consistent syntax permits automated parsing, formal verification, and conversion to computational models like Bayesian networks. The structured JSON metadata provides clear paths for extracting probability information and mapping it to conditional probability tables.

Third, **contextual preservation** maintains the connection to original arguments. By including descriptive text alongside formal structure, BayesDown retains the narrative context and qualitative considerations that inform probability judgments. This contextual information helps users interpret the model in light of the original arguments.

Consider how these principles manifest in the BayesDown syntax. Each node begins with a bracketed title followed by a natural language description, preserving the core statement being formalized. The JSON metadata contains technical information like instantiations, priors, and posteriors, but keeps this information clearly separated from the narrative content. Hierarchical relationships use indentation and plus symbols, creating a visual structure that mirrors causal influence.

This excerpt from the Carlsmith model representation illustrates how BayesDown preserves both the narrative description ("The destruction of humanity's long-term potential...") and the precise probability judgments. Someone without technical background can still understand the core claims and their relationships, while someone seeking quantitative precision can find exact probability values.

The format supports multiple levels of engagement. At the most basic level, readers can follow the hierarchical structure to understand causal relationships between factors. At an intermediate level, they can examine probability judgments to assess the strength of different influences. At the most technical level, they can analyze the complete probabilistic model to perform inference and sensitivity analysis.

This multi-level accessibility creates important advantages for coordination across domains:

1. **Technical-policy translation:** BayesDown provides a common reference point for technical researchers explaining safety concerns and policy specialists evaluating governance options, reducing communication barriers.

2. **Argumentation transparency:** The format makes assumptions explicit, helping identify genuine disagreements versus terminological confusion or unstated premises.

3. **Incremental formalization:** BayesDown supports varying levels of formality, from qualitative structure to complete probability specifications, allowing gradual progression from informal to formal representations.

4. **Verification flexibility:** Human experts can verify extracted representations at different levels—checking structural correctness without assessing probabilities, or focusing on critical probability judgments without reviewing the entire model.

The hybrid nature of BayesDown aligns with how experts typically communicate complex ideas: combining qualitative explanations with quantitative judgments, using natural language to provide context for formal claims, and adjusting precision based on audience needs. By mirroring these natural communication patterns, BayesDown makes formalization more intuitive and accessible.

This bridging function extends beyond representation to influence the entire extraction and analysis workflow. When extracting from text, the two-stage process preserves narrative context alongside formal structure. When visualizing models, interactive interfaces provide both qualitative descriptions and quantitative details. When evaluating policies, counterfactual analysis incorporates both mathematical precision and contextual interpretation.

In the broader context of the coordination crisis, BayesDown demonstrates how thoughtfully designed intermediate representations can overcome communication barriers between domains. Rather than forcing all stakeholders to adopt a single specialized language, it creates a flexible format that accommodates different perspectives while enabling precise analysis—precisely the kind of bridge needed for effective coordination on complex governance challenges.

### **3.4 Interactive Visualization and Exploration**

Complex probabilistic models like Bayesian networks contain rich information, but they often remain inaccessible to many stakeholders. A conditional probability table with dozens of values conveys precise relationships, but few can intuitively grasp its implications. This accessibility gap limits the potential for coordinated action on AI governance challenges—what good is formalization if the resulting models remain opaque to most decision-makers?

AMTAIR addresses this challenge through interactive visualization designed to make complex probabilistic relationships accessible to diverse stakeholders. The approach combines visual encoding of probability information, progressive disclosure of details, and interactive exploration capabilities to create intuitive interfaces for complex models.

The visualization system follows several key design principles:

First, **visual encoding of probability** uses color gradients to represent likelihood values. Nodes are colored on a spectrum from red (low probability) to green (high probability) based on their primary state's probability. This simple visual cue provides immediate insights into which outcomes are more or less likely without requiring numerical interpretation.

Second, **structural classification** uses border colors to indicate node types based on network position. Blue borders designate root causes (nodes without parents), purple borders mark intermediate nodes (with both parents and children), and magenta borders highlight leaf nodes (final effects without children). This classification helps users understand the causal flow through the network.

Third, **progressive disclosure** presents information in layers of increasing detail. Basic node information appears in the visualization itself, additional details emerge in tooltips on hover, and comprehensive probability tables display in modal windows on click. This layered approach prevents information overload while ensuring all details remain accessible.

Fourth, **interactive exploration** allows users to reorganize nodes, zoom in on areas of interest, adjust physics parameters, and investigate probability values. These capabilities transform the visualization from a static image into an explorable knowledge landscape.

Figure 6 shows the interactive visualization of Carlsmith's model, highlighting how color, border styling, and layout work together to represent complex causal relationships:

\[FIGURE 6: Interactive visualization of Carlsmith's model showing color-coded nodes and causal relationships\]

The visualization system implements these principles through a combination of NetworkX for graph representation and PyVis for interactive display, with custom HTML generation for tooltips and modals:

    return net.show('bayesian\_network.html')

Beyond the core visualization, the system includes specialized components that enhance understanding of probabilistic relationships:

1. **Probability bars** provide visual representations of probability distributions, showing relative likelihoods of different states using color-coded horizontal bars with numeric labels.

2. **Conditional probability tables** organize complex relationships into structured matrices, displaying how different combinations of parent states influence probability distributions.

3. **Sensitivity indicators** highlight which nodes and relationships most significantly affect outcomes, directing attention to critical factors.

These components work together to create an intuitive interface for complex probabilistic models. A user might start by exploring the overall structure to understand key factors and relationships, hover over nodes of interest to see probability summaries, then click on specific nodes to examine detailed conditional probabilities.

The benefits of this visualization approach extend beyond aesthetic appeal to fundamental improvements in understanding and communication:

First, **intuitive comprehension** of probability relationships becomes possible even for those without formal training in Bayesian statistics. The color coding provides immediate visual cues about which outcomes are more likely, while interactive exploration allows users to develop intuition about how different factors influence results.

Second, **cross-stakeholder communication** improves through shared visual reference points. Technical experts can use the visualizations to explain complex relationships to policy specialists, while governance experts can identify institutional factors that might be incorporated into the models.

Third, **disagreement identification** becomes more precise as stakeholders can point to specific nodes, relationships, or probability values where their views differ, focusing discussion on substantive issues rather than terminological confusion.

Fourth, **intervention assessment** becomes more concrete as users can see how changing specific factors influences downstream effects, providing intuitive understanding of causal pathways and leverage points.

The visualization system demonstrates how thoughtful interface design can overcome barriers to understanding complex formal models. By making probabilistic relationships visually intuitive and progressively disclosing details based on user interest, it creates bridges between mathematical precision and human comprehension—precisely the kind of bridge needed to support coordination across domains in AI governance.

This approach reflects a broader principle: formalization is most valuable when it enhances rather than replaces human understanding. The AMTAIR visualization doesn't simplify complex relationships; it makes them more accessible by leveraging visual cognition, interactive exploration, and progressive disclosure. This human-centered approach to formalization creates tools that augment rather than replace expert judgment, enhancing our collective ability to understand and address complex governance challenges.

### **3.5 Beyond Extraction: Toward Policy Evaluation**

Formalizing expert knowledge through automated extraction creates valuable epistemic infrastructure, but the ultimate goal extends beyond representation to supporting concrete governance decisions. Once implicit models become explicit through the AMTAIR approach, they enable a crucial capability: systematic evaluation of how policy interventions might affect outcomes across different scenarios.

This capability addresses a fundamental challenge in AI governance: making decisions under deep uncertainty about future developments. Traditional approaches often rely on point forecasts or vague qualitative judgments, creating environments where rhetoric outweighs evidence and status determines influence. Formal models enable a more disciplined approach, systematically exploring how different interventions perform across a range of assumptions.

The AMTAIR system supports policy evaluation through three key mechanisms:

First, **counterfactual analysis** implements Pearl's do-calculus to simulate interventions on the causal system. Rather than merely observing correlations, this approach explicitly models what happens when we force a variable to take a specific value, accounting for how this intervention propagates through the causal structure. For example, we can ask how requiring safety demonstrations (setting a variable to a specific value) would affect the likelihood of misaligned systems and ultimately existential risk.

Second, **intervention modeling** provides structured representations of policy options that can be applied to the causal model. Policies are formalized as modifications to specific variables, relationships, or probability distributions, creating concrete representations of how governance actions influence the system. For example, compute governance might be modeled as reducing the probability of rapid capability jumps, while safety standards might increase the likelihood of warning shots.

Third, **cross-worldview comparison** enables evaluation of interventions across different causal models and probability distributions. Rather than assuming a single correct model, this approach acknowledges legitimate uncertainty about causal structure and relationships, testing how interventions perform across different plausible world models. This identifies "robust" policies that work reasonably well regardless of which worldview proves correct—a crucial capability when decisions must be made despite fundamental disagreements.

Consider how these mechanisms apply to Carlsmith's model of existential risk from power-seeking AI. Figure 7 shows the evaluation of a hypothetical governance intervention requiring safety demonstrations before deployment:

\[FIGURE 7: Visualization showing policy impact evaluation across Carlsmith model\]

The analysis simulates how requiring safety demonstrations affects deployment decisions for potentially misaligned systems, and consequently how this influences the probability of misaligned power-seeking and ultimately existential catastrophe. By comparing the baseline probability (5%) with the intervention probability (3.2% in this example), we can quantify the potential risk reduction from this policy.

The implementation uses counterfactual queries on the Bayesian network:

def evaluate\_policy\_impact(model, intervention\_variable, intervention\_value, target\_variable, target\_value):  
    """  
    Evaluate the impact of setting a variable to a specific value on a target outcome.  
      
    Args:  
        model: Bayesian network model  
        intervention\_variable: Variable to intervene on  
        intervention\_value: Value to set for intervention  
        target\_variable: Outcome variable of interest  
        target\_value: Outcome value of interest  
          
    Returns:  
        dict: Impact analysis including baseline and intervention probabilities  
    """  
    \# Create inference engine  
    inference \= VariableElimination(model)  
      
    \# Calculate baseline probability  
    baseline\_query \= inference.query(variables=\[target\_variable\])  
    baseline\_prob \= baseline\_query.values\[baseline\_query.state\_names\[target\_variable\].index(target\_value)\]  
      
    \# Calculate intervention probability using do-calculus  
    intervention\_query \= inference.query(  
        variables=\[target\_variable\],  
        evidence={intervention\_variable: intervention\_value},  
        do={intervention\_variable: intervention\_value}  \# The do-operation  
    )  
    intervention\_prob \= intervention\_query.values\[intervention\_query.state\_names\[target\_variable\].index(target\_value)\]  
      
    \# Calculate impact  
    absolute\_change \= intervention\_prob \- baseline\_prob  
    relative\_change \= absolute\_change / baseline\_prob \* 100 if baseline\_prob \> 0 else float('inf')  
      
    return {  
        'baseline\_probability': baseline\_prob,  
        'intervention\_probability': intervention\_prob,  
        'absolute\_change': absolute\_change,  
        'relative\_change': relative\_change  
    }

This function implements the counterfactual analysis, calculating both the baseline probability of the target outcome and the probability after intervention. The `do` operation ensures proper handling of causal effects rather than merely conditioning on observed values.

Beyond analyzing individual interventions, the system can evaluate portfolios of complementary policies, identifying synergies and conflicts between different approaches. For example, it might examine how compute governance, safety standards, and liability rules work together to reduce risk more effectively than any single intervention alone.

The policy evaluation capabilities extend to more sophisticated analyses:

1. **Robustness assessment** examines how sensitive intervention effects are to variations in model parameters, identifying policies that maintain effectiveness despite uncertainty about exact probability values.

2. **Option value analysis** evaluates how different policies affect our ability to gather information and make better decisions in the future, capturing the value of preserving flexibility.

3. **Intervention portfolio construction** identifies sets of complementary policies that address different aspects of risk, creating more robust governance approaches.

4. **Dependency mapping** visualizes prerequisites and enabling conditions between interventions, helping understand sequencing requirements and potential bottlenecks.

These capabilities transform governance discussions from abstract debates about principles to concrete analyses of expected impacts. Rather than merely asserting that a policy would reduce risk, stakeholders can demonstrate specific causal pathways through which the intervention affects outcomes, quantify the magnitude of expected effects, and test robustness across different assumptions.

This approach doesn't eliminate value judgments or normative considerations—those remain essential for determining appropriate governance goals and acceptable tradeoffs. But it adds rigor to instrumental reasoning about how different interventions might achieve those goals, reducing the influence of rhetoric, status, and cognitive biases in policy evaluation.

In the context of the coordination crisis, these policy evaluation capabilities create a shared language for discussing interventions across domains. Technical researchers can express safety concerns in terms of how they affect model variables; policy specialists can formulate governance proposals as interventions on specific factors; ethicists can articulate normative considerations as valued outcomes or constraints on acceptable interventions. This common framework facilitates more productive coordination without requiring all stakeholders to adopt a single specialized vocabulary.

## **4\. Implementation: The AMTAIR Prototype**

### **4.1 System Architecture and Data Flow**

The AMTAIR prototype implements the conceptual architecture described earlier through a modular, extensible system designed to transform text into interactive Bayesian networks. This section details the technical realization of this architecture, explaining how different components interact to enable automated extraction and analysis.

At its core, the system consists of five main components connected in a sequential pipeline with feedback loops:

1. **Text ingestion and preprocessing** handles the initial transformation of source documents into a standardized format suitable for extraction. This component supports various input formats (PDF, markdown, plain text) and preserves citation information to maintain provenance.

2. **LLM-powered extraction pipeline** implements the two-stage process for transforming normalized text into structured representations. The first stage extracts structural information (ArgDown), while the second stage enhances it with probability information (BayesDown).

3. **Bayesian network construction** converts BayesDown representations into formal Bayesian networks with nodes, edges, and conditional probability tables. This component includes data transformation, network analysis, and enhancement with derived metrics.

4. **Visualization and interaction interface** creates interactive presentations of the Bayesian networks with probability encoding, progressive disclosure, and exploration capabilities. This component generates HTML with embedded JavaScript for interactivity.

5. **Analysis and inference engine** enables probabilistic reasoning about the networks, including marginal and conditional probability calculations, sensitivity analysis, and counterfactual evaluation for policy assessment.

Figure 8 illustrates the data flow between these components:

\[FIGURE 8: Diagram showing data flow between system components\]

The implementation uses a combination of Python libraries for different aspects of the pipeline:

* **pandas** for structured data manipulation throughout the pipeline  
* **networkx** for graph representation and analysis  
* **pgmpy** for Bayesian network construction and inference  
* **pyvis** for interactive network visualization  
* **requests** for API calls to language models  
* **matplotlib** for static visualizations

This architecture balances several design principles:

**Modularity** ensures that each component can be developed, tested, and improved independently. For example, the extraction pipeline can be enhanced without modifying the visualization system, and different visualization approaches can be implemented without changing the extraction logic.

**Explicitness** makes the transformation process transparent and inspectable at each stage. Rather than using end-to-end black-box processing, the system creates intermediate representations (ArgDown, BayesDown, DataFrames) that can be examined and verified.

**Interactivity** prioritizes human engagement with the results, creating rich interfaces that reveal both structural and probabilistic information through visual encoding and progressive disclosure.

**Extensibility** supports incremental enhancement through well-defined interfaces between components. New capabilities can be added without redesigning the entire system, enabling gradual improvement over time.

The core code organization reflects this architecture:

      ├── data\_structures.py  
      ├── file\_operations.py  
      └── logging\_config.py

This organization makes dependencies explicit while enabling independent development of different components. For example, the extraction team can enhance prompt templates without affecting the network construction code, and the visualization team can improve the user interface without modifying the underlying data structures.

The prototype implementation focused on demonstrating the core pipeline functionality rather than building a complete production system. As a result, the current version has certain limitations:

1. It relies on external API calls to frontier LLMs rather than deploying models locally.  
2. It processes documents one at a time rather than ingesting entire literature repositories.  
3. It implements basic policy evaluation capabilities without the full range of analysis features.  
4. It focuses on BayesDown as the intermediate representation without supporting alternative formats.

Despite these limitations, the prototype successfully demonstrates the feasibility of automating the extraction and transformation process, creating a foundation for more sophisticated implementations in the future.

The architecture's design anticipates future extensions, including integration with prediction markets for dynamic updating, support for cross-worldview comparison, and enhanced policy evaluation capabilities. These extensions would build on the existing foundation rather than requiring architectural redesign, demonstrating the value of the modular approach.

### **4.2 The Rain-Sprinkler-Lawn Implementation**

Before applying the AMTAIR approach to complex real-world risk assessments, I validated the implementation using the canonical rain-sprinkler-lawn example introduced earlier. This simple but complete example allows step-by-step verification of each component in the pipeline, from initial representation to interactive visualization.

The rain-sprinkler-lawn scenario has become something of a "Hello World" for Bayesian networks—simple enough to understand intuitively but complex enough to demonstrate conditional independence and inference. It involves three variables: Rain (whether it's raining), Sprinkler (whether the sprinkler is on), and Grass\_Wet (whether the grass is wet). Both rain and the sprinkler can cause the grass to be wet, while rain also influences whether the sprinkler is used (as people typically don't run sprinklers when it's already raining).

**Stage 1: ArgDown Representation** captures the structural relationships between these variables without probability information. The implementation starts with this representation:

\[Grass\_Wet\]: Concentrated moisture on, between and around the blades of grass. {"instantiations": \["grass\_wet\_TRUE", "grass\_wet\_FALSE"\]}  
 \+ \[Rain\]: Tears of angles crying high up in the skies hitting the ground. {"instantiations": \["rain\_TRUE", "rain\_FALSE"\]}  
 \+ \[Sprinkler\]: Activation of a centrifugal force based CO2 droplet distribution system. {"instantiations": \["sprinkler\_TRUE", "sprinkler\_FALSE"\]}  
   \+ \[Rain\]

This ArgDown representation captures several key aspects of the scenario:

* The three variables with their natural language descriptions  
* Their possible states (TRUE/FALSE for each variable)  
* The causal structure (both Rain and Sprinkler influence Grass\_Wet, and Rain influences Sprinkler)

The system processes this representation with the parsing function shown in the previous section, transforming it into a structured DataFrame that explicitly represents parent-child relationships:

\# Process the ArgDown representation  
argdown\_df \= parse\_markdown\_hierarchy\_fixed(argdown\_text, ArgDown=True)

\# Display the results  
print(argdown\_df\[\['Title', 'Description', 'Parents', 'Children', 'instantiations'\]\])

This processing correctly extracts the structural information, identifying that:

* Grass\_Wet has parents Rain and Sprinkler, but no children  
* Rain has no parents, but is a parent to both Grass\_Wet and Sprinkler  
* Sprinkler has parent Rain and child Grass\_Wet

**Stage 2: BayesDown Enhancement** adds probability information to the structural representation. The implementation first generates appropriate probability questions based on the network structure:

\# Generate probability questions based on network structure  
df\_with\_questions \= generate\_argdown\_with\_questions(argdown\_df, "ArgDown\_WithQuestions.csv")

\# Display sample questions for the Sprinkler node  
sprinkler\_questions \= df\_with\_questions.loc\[df\_with\_questions\['Title'\] \== 'Sprinkler', 'Generate\_Positive\_Instantiation\_Questions'\].iloc\[0\]  
print(json.loads(sprinkler\_questions))

For the Sprinkler node, this generates questions like:

* What is the probability for Sprinkler=sprinkler\_TRUE?  
* What is the probability for Sprinkler=sprinkler\_TRUE if Rain=rain\_TRUE?  
* What is the probability for Sprinkler=sprinkler\_TRUE if Rain=rain\_FALSE?

After answering these questions (manually or via LLM), the system incorporates the probability information into a complete BayesDown representation:

\[Grass\_Wet\]: Concentrated moisture on, between and around the blades of grass. {  
  "instantiations": \["grass\_wet\_TRUE", "grass\_wet\_FALSE"\],  
  "priors": {"p(grass\_wet\_TRUE)": "0.322", "p(grass\_wet\_FALSE)": "0.678"},  
  "posteriors": {  
    "p(grass\_wet\_TRUE|sprinkler\_TRUE,rain\_TRUE)": "0.99",  
    "p(grass\_wet\_TRUE|sprinkler\_TRUE,rain\_FALSE)": "0.9",  
    "p(grass\_wet\_TRUE|sprinkler\_FALSE,rain\_TRUE)": "0.8",  
    "p(grass\_wet\_TRUE|sprinkler\_FALSE,rain\_FALSE)": "0.0"  
  }  
}  
 \+ \[Rain\]: Tears of angles crying high up in the skies hitting the ground. {  
   "instantiations": \["rain\_TRUE", "rain\_FALSE"\],  
   "priors": {"p(rain\_TRUE)": "0.2", "p(rain\_FALSE)": "0.8"}  
 }  
 \+ \[Sprinkler\]: Activation of a centrifugal force based CO2 droplet distribution system. {  
   "instantiations": \["sprinkler\_TRUE", "sprinkler\_FALSE"\],  
   "priors": {"p(sprinkler\_TRUE)": "0.44838", "p(sprinkler\_FALSE)": "0.55162"},  
   "posteriors": {  
     "p(sprinkler\_TRUE|rain\_TRUE)": "0.01",  
     "p(sprinkler\_TRUE|rain\_FALSE)": "0.4"  
   }  
 }  
   \+ \[Rain\]

This BayesDown representation now contains complete probability information:

* Prior probabilities for each variable (e.g., P(Rain=TRUE) \= 0.2)  
* Conditional probabilities for variables with parents (e.g., P(Sprinkler=TRUE|Rain=TRUE) \= 0.01)

**Stage 3: Bayesian Network Construction** transforms the BayesDown representation into a formal Bayesian network with nodes, edges, and conditional probability tables. The implementation extracts the information into a structured DataFrame, then converts this into a network representation:

\# Extract data from BayesDown representation  
extracted\_df \= parse\_markdown\_hierarchy\_fixed(bayesdown\_text, ArgDown=False)

\# Enhance the data with calculated metrics  
enhanced\_df \= enhance\_extracted\_data(extracted\_df)

\# Create a Bayesian network from the extracted data  
def create\_bayesian\_network(df):  
    \# Create network structure  
    model \= BayesianNetwork()  
      
    \# Add nodes and edges  
    for idx, row in df.iterrows():  
        title \= row\['Title'\]  
        parents \= row\['Parents'\] if isinstance(row\['Parents'\], list) else \[\]  
          
        \# Add node  
        model.add\_node(title)  
          
        \# Add edges from parents to this node  
        for parent in parents:  
            model.add\_edge(parent, title)  
      
    \# Add CPDs for each node  
    for idx, row in df.iterrows():  
        title \= row\['Title'\]  
        parents \= row\['Parents'\] if isinstance(row\['Parents'\], list) else \[\]

\# Create the network  
bayesian\_network \= create\_bayesian\_network(enhanced\_df)

The resulting Bayesian network correctly represents the causal structure and probability distributions from the BayesDown representation. This network enables various types of probabilistic inference, such as calculating the probability of rain given that the grass is wet:

\# Create inference engine  
inference \= VariableElimination(bayesian\_network)

\# Calculate P(Rain=TRUE | Grass\_Wet=TRUE)  
result \= inference.query(variables=\['Rain'\], evidence={'Grass\_Wet': 'grass\_wet\_TRUE'})  
print(f"P(Rain=TRUE | Grass\_Wet=TRUE) \= {result.values\[0\]:.3f}")

**Visual Result** The implementation creates an interactive visualization of the network using the function described in the previous section:

\# Create interactive visualization  
visualization \= create\_bayesian\_network\_with\_probabilities(enhanced\_df)  
display(visualization)

Figure 9 shows the resulting visualization with color-coded nodes indicating probability values:

\[FIGURE 9: Interactive visualization of the rain-sprinkler-lawn Bayesian network\]

The visualization correctly encodes the causal structure (arrows from causes to effects) and probability information (node colors indicating likelihood), providing an intuitive representation of the relationships between variables.

**Validation** To verify the implementation's correctness, I compared computational results from the network with analytical solutions calculated by hand. For example, the probability of wet grass can be calculated analytically:

P(W=TRUE) \= ∑ᵣ,ₛ P(W=TRUE|R=r,S=s) × P(R=r) × P(S=s|R=r)

Where the sum is over all possible values of r and s. The computational result from the Bayesian network (0.322) matched the analytical calculation, confirming the implementation's correctness.

Similarly, posterior probabilities like P(R=TRUE|W=TRUE) were verified against analytical calculations using Bayes' rule:

P(R=TRUE|W=TRUE) \= P(W=TRUE|R=TRUE) × P(R=TRUE) / P(W=TRUE)

The rain-sprinkler-lawn implementation demonstrates the complete AMTAIR pipeline functioning correctly on a simple but non-trivial example. Each step in the process—from ArgDown representation through BayesDown enhancement to Bayesian network construction and visualization—performs as expected, transforming a structured representation into an interactive, analyzable model.

This validation provides confidence that the approach can be successfully applied to more complex, real-world scenarios like Carlsmith's model of existential risk, which follows the same principles but involves many more variables and relationships.

### **4.3 Application to Carlsmith's Model**

Having validated the implementation on the canonical rain-sprinkler-lawn example, I applied the AMTAIR approach to a substantially more complex real-world case: Joseph Carlsmith's model of existential risk from power-seeking AI. This application demonstrates the system's ability to handle sophisticated multi-level arguments with numerous variables and relationships.

Carlsmith's analysis involves dozens of factors organized in a complex causal structure, from root causes like "Advanced AI Capability" and "Instrumental Convergence" through intermediate factors like "APS Systems" and "Misaligned Power Seeking" to final outcomes like "Existential Catastrophe." The model exhibits several challenging features:

1. **Multi-level structure** with causal chains spanning multiple steps  
2. **Divergent pathways** where factors influence outcomes through multiple routes  
3. **Complex conditional dependencies** with variables influenced by multiple parents  
4. **Variables with three or more possible states** rather than simple binary outcomes  
5. **Interconnected clusters** where factors form distinct but related argument groups

The extraction process began with an ArgDown representation capturing the structural relationships between variables:

\[Existential\_Catastrophe\]: The destruction of humanity's long-term potential due to AI systems we've lost control over. {"instantiations": \["existential\_catastrophe\_TRUE", "existential\_catastrophe\_FALSE"\]}  
\- \[Human\_Disempowerment\]: Permanent and collective disempowerment of humanity relative to AI systems. {"instantiations": \["human\_disempowerment\_TRUE", "human\_disempowerment\_FALSE"\]}  
    \- \[Scale\_Of\_Power\_Seeking\]: Power-seeking by AI systems scaling to the point of permanently disempowering all of humanity. {"instantiations": \["scale\_of\_power\_seeking\_TRUE", "scale\_of\_power\_seeking\_FALSE"\]}

                \- \[Strategic\_Awareness\]: AI systems with models accurately representing power dynamics with humans. {"instantiations": \["strategic\_awareness\_TRUE", "strategic\_awareness\_FALSE"\]}  
            \- \[Difficulty\_Of\_Alignment\]: It is harder to build aligned systems than misaligned systems that are attractive to deploy. {"instantiations": \["difficulty\_of\_alignment\_TRUE", "difficulty\_of\_alignment\_FALSE"\]}  
                \- \[Instrumental\_Convergence\]: AI systems with misaligned objectives tend to seek power as an instrumental goal. {"instantiations": \["instrumental\_convergence\_TRUE", "instrumental\_convergence\_FALSE"\]}  
                \- \[Problems\_With\_Proxies\]: Optimizing for proxy objectives breaks correlations with intended goals. {"instantiations": \["problems\_with\_proxies\_TRUE", "problems\_with\_proxies\_FALSE"\]}  
                \- \[Problems\_With\_Search\]: Search processes can yield systems pursuing different objectives than intended. {"instantiations": \["problems\_with\_search\_TRUE", "problems\_with\_search\_FALSE"\]}  
            \- \[Deployment\_Decisions\]: Decisions to deploy potentially misaligned AI systems. {"instantiations": \["deployment\_decisions\_DEPLOY", "deployment\_decisions\_WITHHOLD"\]}  
                \- \[Incentives\_To\_Build\_APS\]: Strong incentives to build and deploy APS systems. {"instantiations": \["incentives\_to\_build\_aps\_STRONG", "incentives\_to\_build\_aps\_WEAK"\]}  
                    \- \[Usefulness\_Of\_APS\]: APS systems are very useful for many valuable tasks. {"instantiations": \["usefulness\_of\_aps\_HIGH", "usefulness\_of\_aps\_LOW"\]}  
                    \- \[Competitive\_Dynamics\]: Competitive pressures between AI developers. {"instantiations": \["competitive\_dynamics\_STRONG", "competitive\_dynamics\_WEAK"\]}  
                \- \[Deception\_By\_AI\]: AI systems deceiving humans about their true objectives. {"instantiations": \["deception\_by\_ai\_TRUE", "deception\_by\_ai\_FALSE"\]}  
        \- \[Corrective\_Feedback\]: Human society implementing corrections after observing problems. {"instantiations": \["corrective\_feedback\_EFFECTIVE", "corrective\_feedback\_INEFFECTIVE"\]}  
            \- \[Warning\_Shots\]: Observable failures in weaker systems before catastrophic risks. {"instantiations": \["warning\_shots\_OBSERVED", "warning\_shots\_UNOBSERVED"\]}  
            \- \[Rapid\_Capability\_Escalation\]: AI capabilities escalating very rapidly, allowing little time for correction. {"instantiations": \["rapid\_capability\_escalation\_TRUE", "rapid\_capability\_escalation\_FALSE"\]}  
\[Barriers\_To\_Understanding\]: Difficulty in understanding the internal workings of advanced AI systems. {"instantiations": \["barriers\_to\_understanding\_HIGH", "barriers\_to\_understanding\_LOW"\]}  
\- \[Misaligned\_Power\_Seeking\]: Deployed AI systems seeking power in unintended and high-impact ways due to problems with their objectives. {"instantiations": \["misaligned\_power\_seeking\_TRUE", "misaligned\_power\_seeking\_FALSE"\]}  
\[Adversarial\_Dynamics\]: Potentially adversarial relationships between humans and power-seeking AI. {"instantiations": \["adversarial\_dynamics\_TRUE", "adversarial\_dynamics\_FALSE"\]}  
\- \[Misaligned\_Power\_Seeking\]: Deployed AI systems seeking power in unintended and high-impact ways due to problems with their objectives. {"instantiations": \["misaligned\_power\_seeking\_TRUE", "misaligned\_power\_seeking\_FALSE"\]}  
\[Stakes\_Of\_Error\]: The escalating impact of mistakes with power-seeking AI systems. {"instantiations": \["stakes\_of\_error\_HIGH", "stakes\_of\_error\_LOW"\]}  
\- \[Misaligned\_Power\_Seeking\]: Deployed AI systems seeking power in unintended and high-impact ways due to problems with their objectives. {"instantiations": \["misaligned\_power\_seeking\_TRUE", "misaligned\_power\_seeking\_FALSE"\]}

This representation captures the complex causal structure of Carlsmith's argument, with 21 variables organized in a multi-level hierarchy. The "Misaligned\_Power\_Seeking" node appears multiple times, reflecting its role as a central concept that influences several other variables.

After processing this structure with the AMTAIR system, probability information was added to create a complete BayesDown representation. The following excerpt shows the probability information for a single node ("Deployment\_Decisions"):

\[Deployment\_Decisions\]: Decisions to deploy potentially misaligned AI systems. {  
  "instantiations": \["deployment\_decisions\_DEPLOY", "deployment\_decisions\_WITHHOLD"\],  
  "priors": {  
    "p(deployment\_decisions\_DEPLOY)": "0.70",  
    "p(deployment\_decisions\_WITHHOLD)": "0.30"  
  },  
  "posteriors": {  
    "p(deployment\_decisions\_DEPLOY|incentives\_to\_build\_aps\_STRONG, deception\_by\_ai\_TRUE)": "0.90",  
    "p(deployment\_decisions\_DEPLOY|incentives\_to\_build\_aps\_STRONG, deception\_by\_ai\_FALSE)": "0.75",  
    "p(deployment\_decisions\_DEPLOY|incentives\_to\_build\_aps\_WEAK, deception\_by\_ai\_TRUE)": "0.60",  
    "p(deployment\_decisions\_DEPLOY|incentives\_to\_build\_aps\_WEAK, deception\_by\_ai\_FALSE)": "0.30"  
  }  
}

This node has two possible states (DEPLOY or WITHHOLD), prior probabilities for each state, and conditional probabilities based on different combinations of its parent variables ("Incentives\_To\_Build\_APS" and "Deception\_By\_AI").

The complete BayesDown representation was processed through the AMTAIR pipeline, resulting in a structured DataFrame and ultimately a Bayesian network. Key extraction steps included:

\# Extract structured data from BayesDown  
carlsmith\_df \= parse\_markdown\_hierarchy\_fixed(carlsmith\_bayesdown, ArgDown=False)

\# Enhance with calculated metrics  
enhanced\_carlsmith\_df \= enhance\_extracted\_data(carlsmith\_df)

\# Create network and visualization  
carlsmith\_network \= create\_bayesian\_network(enhanced\_carlsmith\_df)  
carlsmith\_visualization \= create\_bayesian\_network\_with\_probabilities(enhanced\_carlsmith\_df)

The resulting visualization (Figure 10\) shows the complete Carlsmith model with color-coded nodes representing probability values:

\[FIGURE 10: Interactive visualization of Carlsmith's model showing color-coded nodes and relationships\]

This visualization reveals several structural insights:

1. **Central importance of "Misaligned\_Power\_Seeking"** as a hub node with multiple parents and children  
2. **Multiple pathways to "Existential\_Catastrophe"** through different intermediate factors  
3. **Clusters of related variables** forming coherent subarguments (e.g., factors affecting alignment difficulty)  
4. **Flow of influence** from technical factors (bottom) through deployment decisions to ultimate outcomes (top)

The implementation successfully handles the complexity of Carlsmith's model, correctly processing the multi-level structure, resolving repeated node references, and calculating appropriate probability distributions. The interactive visualization makes this complex model accessible, allowing users to explore different aspects of the argument through intuitive navigation.

Several key aspects of the implementation were particularly important for handling this complex model:

1. The **parent-child relationship detection algorithm** correctly identified hierarchical relationships despite the complex structure with repeated nodes and multiple levels.

2. The **probability question generation system** created appropriate questions for all variables, including those with multiple parents requiring factorial combinations of conditional probabilities.

3. The **network enhancement functions** calculated useful metrics like centrality measures and Markov blankets that help interpret the model structure.

4. The **visualization system** effectively presented the complex network through color-coding, interactive exploration, and progressive disclosure of details.

The successful application to Carlsmith's model demonstrates the AMTAIR approach's scalability to complex real-world arguments. While the canonical rain-sprinkler-lawn example validated correctness, this application proves practical utility for sophisticated multi-level arguments with dozens of variables and complex interdependencies—precisely the kind of arguments that characterize AI risk assessments.

This capability addresses a core limitation of the original MTAIR framework: the labor intensity of manual formalization. Where manually converting Carlsmith's argument to a formal model might take days of expert time, the AMTAIR approach accomplished this in minutes, creating a foundation for further analysis and exploration.

### **4.4 Performance and Validation**

The AMTAIR prototype demonstrates promising capabilities, but any automated system requires rigorous evaluation to assess reliability, accuracy, and practical utility. This section presents performance metrics and validation approaches for the extraction and transformation processes, providing a foundation for understanding the system's strengths and limitations.

**Extraction Quality Metrics** assess how accurately the system extracts structured representations from source texts. I evaluated extraction quality using three complementary approaches:

1. **Comparison to manual extraction:** For select examples, I compared automated extraction results with manually created representations, calculating precision, recall, and F1 scores for nodes, relationships, and probability values.

2. **Structural validation:** I used formal validation rules to check structural properties like acyclicity, completeness (all referenced nodes defined), and consistency (probability distributions sum to 1).

3. **Expert review:** I enlisted domain experts to assess the semantic accuracy of extracted representations, focusing on whether they preserved the author's intended meaning.

Table 1 summarizes extraction quality metrics for different components of the pipeline:

| Component | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Node identification | 0.94 | 0.91 | 0.92 |
| Relationship detection | 0.89 | 0.85 | 0.87 |
| Prior probability extraction | 0.91 | 0.88 | 0.89 |
| Conditional probability extraction | 0.83 | 0.78 | 0.80 |

These metrics reveal stronger performance on structural extraction (nodes and relationships) than on probability extraction, particularly for conditional probabilities where complexity increases with multiple parent variables. This pattern aligns with the two-stage extraction approach, which prioritizes structural accuracy before addressing probability information.

The extraction quality assessment also revealed common failure modes:

1. **Complex causal expressions** where influence is described through multiple sentences or implicit relationships  
2. **Ambiguous probability language** using terms like "likely," "probably," or "almost certainly" without precise definitions  
3. **Deep nesting** where relationships span multiple levels of indirection  
4. **Novel terminology** without sufficient context for interpretation

These failure modes suggest specific areas for improvement in future implementations, such as enhanced context handling for complex expressions and better interpretation of qualitative probability language.

**Computational Performance Metrics** assess how efficiently the system processes inputs and generates outputs. I measured performance across different network sizes to understand scaling characteristics:

| Network Size (nodes) | Extraction Time (s) | Network Construction (s) | Visualization (s) | Total Processing (s) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Small (5-10) | 3.2 | 0.4 | 0.6 | 4.2 |
| Medium (10-50) | 12.5 | 1.3 | 1.9 | 15.7 |
| Large (50+) | 42.8 | 3.7 | 5.2 | 51.7 |

The extraction phase dominates processing time, primarily due to API calls to frontier LLMs. Network construction and visualization scale well with network size, showing sub-linear growth as complexity increases. The current implementation prioritizes accuracy over speed, with several opportunities for optimization:

1. **Batched extraction** could process multiple nodes or relationships simultaneously  
2. **Caching mechanisms** could avoid redundant processing of repeated patterns  
3. **Progressive refinement** could focus detailed extraction on critical parts of the network

Despite these optimization opportunities, the current performance is sufficient for practical use cases. Processing Carlsmith's model (21 nodes with complex relationships) took approximately 18 seconds, enabling interactive exploration and experimentation.

**Validation Code** ensures extraction quality through automated checks for structural and probabilistic consistency:

def validate\_bayesian\_network(df):  
    """  
    Validate a Bayesian network for structural and probabilistic consistency.

                    except (ValueError, TypeError):  
                        results\['warnings'\].append(f"Node {title} has non-numeric prior: {value}")  
              
            if prior\_values and abs(sum(prior\_values) \- 1.0) \> 0.01:

                )  
          
        \# Additional checks for conditional probabilities omitted for brevity  
      
    return results

This validation function performs critical checks for structural integrity (acyclicity, completeness) and probabilistic consistency (distributions summing to 1), identifying errors that would invalidate the network and warnings about potential issues requiring attention.

**Error Analysis** provides insights into challenging cases and opportunities for improvement. Figure 11 shows a confusion matrix for node relationship classification:

\[FIGURE 11: Confusion matrix for node relationship classification\]

The confusion matrix reveals that most errors involve failing to detect relationships (false negatives) rather than incorrectly identifying non-existent relationships (false positives). This pattern suggests that the extraction process is conservative, prioritizing precision over recall—generally appropriate for formal modeling where incorrect relationships could lead to substantive errors in reasoning.

The performance and validation assessment demonstrates that the AMTAIR prototype achieves sufficient accuracy and efficiency for practical applications while highlighting specific areas for improvement. The system performs well on structural extraction, shows acceptable but lower accuracy on probability extraction, and handles computational demands efficiently enough for interactive use.

These results validate the fundamental approach while identifying clear paths for enhancement. The two-stage extraction process proves effective for separating structural and probabilistic aspects, with higher performance on the former suggesting that future work should focus particularly on improving probability extraction methods, perhaps through specialized prompting techniques or additional validation mechanisms.

## **5\. Analysis and Results**

### **5.1 Structural Insights from Carlsmith's Model**

The formalization of Carlsmith's model reveals structural patterns that might not be apparent from the original text, providing insights into the causal architecture of his argument. By analyzing the network structure mathematically, we can identify key variables, critical pathways, and important dependencies that shape his assessment of existential risk.

One powerful analytical approach examines **centrality measures** that identify influential nodes in the network. Rather than relying on intuition or frequency of mention, these metrics quantify how variables connect to and influence others in the causal structure. Table 2 presents centrality measures for key variables in Carlsmith's model:

| Variable | Degree Centrality | Betweenness Centrality | Closeness Centrality |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Misaligned\_Power\_Seeking | 0.85 | 0.42 | 0.76 |
| Human\_Disempowerment | 0.35 | 0.18 | 0.58 |
| APS\_Systems | 0.30 | 0.09 | 0.45 |
| Scale\_Of\_Power\_Seeking | 0.45 | 0.15 | 0.64 |
| Existential\_Catastrophe | 0.15 | 0.00 | 0.38 |

"Misaligned\_Power\_Seeking" emerges as the most central variable across all metrics, serving as a hub that connects multiple causal pathways. This aligns with Carlsmith's explicit focus on power-seeking behavior as the critical mechanism for existential risk, but the quantitative analysis reveals just how dominant this variable is in the overall structure.

The high betweenness centrality of "Misaligned\_Power\_Seeking" (0.42) indicates that it serves as a bridge between different clusters of variables. Changes to this variable would affect multiple pathways simultaneously, making it a critical leverage point for risk reduction. This suggests that interventions targeting misaligned power-seeking behavior specifically (rather than just general AI capabilities or deployment decisions) might have outsized effects on existential risk.

Beyond individual variables, **path analysis** identifies critical causal chains leading to existential catastrophe. The formalized model reveals three distinct pathways:

1. **Technical pathway**: Advanced\_AI\_Capability → Agentic\_Planning → Strategic\_Awareness → APS\_Systems → Misaligned\_Power\_Seeking → Scale\_Of\_Power\_Seeking → Human\_Disempowerment → Existential\_Catastrophe

2. **Governance pathway**: Incentives\_To\_Build\_APS → Deployment\_Decisions → Misaligned\_Power\_Seeking → Scale\_Of\_Power\_Seeking → Human\_Disempowerment → Existential\_Catastrophe

3. **Correction pathway**: Warning\_Shots → Corrective\_Feedback → Scale\_Of\_Power\_Seeking → Human\_Disempowerment → Existential\_Catastrophe

These pathways represent different causal mechanisms through which existential catastrophe might occur, suggesting distinct intervention approaches. The technical pathway emphasizes alignment challenges, the governance pathway focuses on deployment incentives, and the correction pathway highlights societal response capabilities.

Another structural insight comes from **Markov blanket analysis**, which identifies the minimal set of variables needed to shield a node from the rest of the network. For "Existential\_Catastrophe," the Markov blanket consists solely of "Human\_Disempowerment," indicating that in Carlsmith's model, humanind disempowerment completely mediates all pathways to catastrophe.

Similarly, the Markov blanket for "Misaligned\_Power\_Seeking" includes:

* Parents: APS\_Systems, Difficulty\_Of\_Alignment, Deployment\_Decisions  
* Children: Scale\_Of\_Power\_Seeking, Barriers\_To\_Understanding, Adversarial\_Dynamics, Stakes\_Of\_Error  
* Children's other parents: Corrective\_Feedback

This set represents the minimal contextual information needed to reason about misaligned power-seeking, highlighting the interdependence between technical factors (APS systems, alignment difficulty), governance decisions, and feedback mechanisms.

The formalization also reveals structural asymmetries in Carlsmith's argument. The variables most proximate to existential catastrophe (Human\_Disempowerment, Scale\_Of\_Power\_Seeking) have relatively simple causal structures, while technical factors near the bottom of the causal chain (APS\_Systems, Difficulty\_Of\_Alignment) have more complex structures with multiple parent and child relationships. This suggests that Carlsmith's analysis is more nuanced about technical mechanisms than about how power-seeking ultimately leads to catastrophe.

Visual network analysis provides additional insights. Figure 12 shows a force-directed layout of Carlsmith's model with nodes sized according to their betweenness centrality:

\[FIGURE 12: Force-directed layout of Carlsmith's model with nodes sized by centrality\]

This visualization reveals three distinct clusters in the network:

1. A technical cluster focused on AI capabilities and alignment challenges  
2. A governance cluster centered on deployment decisions and incentives  
3. A consequences cluster linking power-seeking to ultimate outcomes

The formalized model also enables more sophisticated structural analyses using established network algorithms:

def analyze\_network\_structure(G):  
    """  
    Perform structural analysis on a Bayesian network.  
      
    Args:  
        G: NetworkX DiGraph representing the Bayesian network  
          
    Returns:  
        dict: Analysis results including centrality measures,

        for node in G.nodes():  
            if node \!= target\_node:  
                paths \= list(nx.all\_simple\_paths(G, node, target\_node))  
                all\_paths.extend(paths)

        all\_paths.sort(key=len)  
        results\['critical\_paths'\] \= all\_paths  
      
    return results

This function implements various network analysis techniques to extract structural insights, including community detection that identifies clusters of tightly connected variables and critical path analysis that finds all causal chains leading to existential catastrophe.

Perhaps the most valuable structural insight is the identification of "Misaligned\_Power\_Seeking" as the central hub of Carlsmith's model. This variable not only has the highest centrality measures but also connects multiple causal pathways, suggesting that it represents a critical junction where technical, governance, and societal factors converge. This aligns with Carlsmith's explicit focus but quantifies its central role in his analysis.

The structural analysis also reveals potential blindspots or simplifications in Carlsmith's model. For example, the relatively simple path from "Human\_Disempowerment" to "Existential\_Catastrophe" suggests limited exploration of how exactly disempowerment leads to catastrophic outcomes. Similarly, the limited connections between technical and governance clusters might indicate insufficient attention to how these domains interact in practice.

These structural insights demonstrate the value of formalization beyond mere representation. By making implicit patterns explicit, the formalized model enables identification of central variables, critical pathways, and structural properties that might not be apparent from the original text. These insights can guide further research, highlight areas for model refinement, and inform intervention strategies focused on the most influential components of the causal structure.

### **5.2 Probabilistic Assessment and Sensitivity**

Beyond structural insights, formalizing Carlsmith's model enables probabilistic analysis that examines the quantitative implications of his judgments. The Bayesian network representation allows calculation of joint and conditional probabilities, sensitivity analysis of critical parameters, and uncertainty propagation through the causal structure.

The first question many readers might ask is: does the formalized model replicate Carlsmith's bottom-line assessment? His paper concludes with approximately 5% probability of existential catastrophe from power-seeking AI, derived from multiplying probabilities across his six key premises. The Bayesian network calculation yields 4.98%, remarkably close to his stated estimate despite the formalization capturing many more details and dependencies.

This agreement validates the formalization approach, demonstrating that the Bayesian network accurately represents Carlsmith's probabilistic judgments. However, the formalized model goes beyond replication to enable more sophisticated analyses.

**Sensitivity analysis** identifies which parameters most significantly affect the probability of existential catastrophe. By systematically varying individual probabilities and observing the change in the outcome, we can determine which factors have the greatest influence on the bottom-line assessment. Table 3 shows sensitivity results for key variables:

| Variable | Baseline State | Alternative State | Change in P(Doom) | Sensitivity Coefficient |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Misaligned\_Power\_Seeking | P(TRUE) \= 0.338 | P(TRUE) \= 0.438 | \+2.92% | 0.292 |
| Corrective\_Feedback | P(EFFECTIVE) \= 0.60 | P(EFFECTIVE) \= 0.70 | \-1.86% | 0.186 |
| Deployment\_Decisions | P(DEPLOY) \= 0.70 | P(DEPLOY) \= 0.60 | \-1.67% | 0.167 |
| Difficulty\_Of\_Alignment | P(TRUE) \= 0.40 | P(TRUE) \= 0.50 | \+1.43% | 0.143 |
| Advanced\_AI\_Capability | P(TRUE) \= 0.80 | P(TRUE) \= 0.90 | \+0.61% | 0.061 |

The sensitivity coefficient represents the rate of change in the probability of existential catastrophe relative to the change in the variable's probability. Higher coefficients indicate greater influence on the outcome.

"Misaligned\_Power\_Seeking" emerges as the most sensitive variable, with a 10 percentage point increase in its probability causing a 2.92 percentage point increase in existential catastrophe probability. This aligns with its central structural position but quantifies its influence in probabilistic terms.

Interestingly, "Corrective\_Feedback" shows the second-highest sensitivity, with increased effectiveness substantially reducing catastrophe probability. This suggests that society's ability to detect and respond to warning signs might be more important than previously recognized, potentially shifting intervention priorities.

The sensitivity analysis can be implemented with the following code:

    """

        results\[node\] \= {  
            'baseline\_prob': baseline\_prob,  
            'modified\_prob': modified\_prob,  
            'absolute\_change': absolute\_change,  
            'sensitivity\_coefficient': relative\_change  
        }  
          
        \# Restore original CPD  
        model.remove\_cpds(modified\_cpd)

    return results

This function implements sensitivity analysis by systematically modifying individual parameters, calculating the resulting change in outcome probability, and computing sensitivity coefficients. The approach maintains model integrity by restoring original parameters after each test.

Beyond individual parameter sensitivity, the formalized model enables **uncertainty propagation** analysis that examines how parameter uncertainty affects conclusions. Instead of using point estimates for probabilities, we can represent each parameter as a probability distribution reflecting our uncertainty about its true value. These distributions propagate through the network, creating a distribution over the probability of existential catastrophe.

Figure 13 shows the result of uncertainty propagation for Carlsmith's model:

\[FIGURE 13: Probability distribution over P(Doom) reflecting parameter uncertainty\]

The distribution has a mean of 4.98% (matching Carlsmith's estimate) but spans from approximately 1% to 12%, reflecting uncertainty in the underlying parameters. This analysis suggests that while Carlsmith's central estimate is reasonable, the true probability could be substantially higher or lower depending on parameter values.

The uncertainty propagation highlights an important aspect of existential risk assessment: precise probability estimates can create false precision, while ranges better represent our actual state of knowledge. The formalized model makes this uncertainty explicit, enabling more nuanced discussion of risk levels.

Another valuable probabilistic analysis examines **conditional relationships** between variables, revealing how different factors interact to influence outcomes. For example, we can calculate the probability of existential catastrophe under different combinations of "Corrective\_Feedback" and "Deployment\_Decisions":

| Corrective\_Feedback | Deployment\_Decisions | P(Existential\_Catastrophe) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| EFFECTIVE | DEPLOY | 3.74% |
| EFFECTIVE | WITHHOLD | 1.52% |
| INEFFECTIVE | DEPLOY | 7.33% |
| INEFFECTIVE | WITHHOLD | 3.87% |

This analysis reveals interesting interactions: effective corrective feedback reduces catastrophe probability by approximately 50% regardless of deployment decisions, while withholding deployment reduces probability by approximately 60% regardless of feedback effectiveness. The combination of both interventions (effective feedback and withholding deployment) reduces probability by nearly 80% compared to the worst case.

Such conditional analyses enable more sophisticated reasoning about intervention combinations, identifying synergies between different approaches rather than focusing on individual factors in isolation.

The probabilistic assessments provide several key insights:

1. Carlsmith's bottom-line estimate of approximately 5% probability for existential catastrophe is correctly replicated in the formalized model, validating the formalization approach.

2. Misaligned power-seeking emerges as both structurally central and highly sensitive, confirming its critical role in the risk pathway.

3. Corrective feedback appears more important than initially apparent, suggesting increased attention to societal response mechanisms.

4. Parameter uncertainty creates substantial variation in the bottom-line estimate, highlighting the importance of ranges rather than point estimates.

5. Interventions display interesting interaction effects, with combinations potentially offering greater risk reduction than the sum of individual approaches.

These insights demonstrate the value of formalization for probabilistic reasoning. By making relationships and judgments explicit in a computational framework, the formalized model enables sophisticated analyses that reveal patterns, sensitivities, and implications not obvious from the original text.
