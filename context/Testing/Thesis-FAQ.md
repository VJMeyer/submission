1. AMTAIR - Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling:
2. Research Question:
	   How can frontier AI technologies be utilized to scale up Modeling Transformative AI Risks from AI safety & governance literature? (And does this automated estimation of probability distributions over conditional trees of possible worlds enhance the forecasting of policy impacts?)
	Research Thesis:
		...
3. Intended Contributions:
	1. Demonstrate feasibility of automated extraction even with current LLMs
	2. Verify that the examples of automated extraction are as good as extraction by human experts
	3. Provide the epistemic framework (possible worlds framing, Bayesianism etc.) for conceptualizing and understanding the new methodology
	4. Highlight the advantages and potential of AMTAIR
	5. etc. ...
4. Target audience:
	1. AI Safety & Governance Researchers (Bostrom, Ord, Carlsmith, Hendryckse, Yudkowsky, Christiano etc. )
	2. Economists working on AI impacts, timelines, scenarios, forecasts etc. (Hanson, Cowen, Caplan, Epoch Team etc.)
	3. AI Policy makers
	4. Munich Center of Mathematical Philosophy
	5. Timo Speith - Thesis Supervisor
5. Formal Frameworks:
	1. Generally all areas/frameworks which the thesis/AMTAIR (implicitly) relies/touches upon
	2. Bayesian epistemology
	3. World modeling - scenario forecasting - causal inference
	4. Informal Logic - argument theory
	5. etc. ...
6. Target Length & Deadline:
	1. Length of 30.000 words
	2. Deadline in late May 2025
7. Software setup:
	1. Quarto book (and manuscript) setup running in VS Code on Apple Silicon Macbook
	2. Obsidian .md files
	3. Zotero for citation management
	4. Submission of both .html, LaTeX & PDF files
	5. Quarto/LaTeX formatting for figures, citations, and cross-references
