You are tasked with creating an exceptionally high-quality, annotated outline for Valentin Meyer's Master's Thesis in Philosophy & Economics.

This outline will serve as the foundation for an iterative drafting process, ultimately resulting in a piece of extraordinary quality suitable for hundreds of thousands of readers.

Your goal is to combine and improve upon a collection of outlines, drafts, and notes, while incorporating new technical documentation and ensuring alignment with the grading rubric.

First, carefully review the following input materials:

Process and explain each in detail.

Now, follow these steps to create the improved outline:

1. Evaluate the existing content critically, considering the coherence, relevance, and completeness of each section.

2. Update every section and point based on the newest technical documentation, especially focusing on the content from the Colab notebook.

3. Ensure that the outline aligns perfectly with the grading rubric, weighing each section accordingly to maximize the potential score.

4. Integrate the "rain/sprinkler/lawn example" and its corresponding code as a walk-through in an appropriate section.

5. Analyze and plan where to include code (snippets) throughout the outline, ensuring they support and illustrate key concepts.

6. Consider the suggested outline order provided in the task description, and determine if and how to incorporate these elements into your improved outline.

7. For each section, subsection, and paragraph, add detailed bullet points that cover their respective contents.

8. Pay special attention to Section 4, updating it extensively based on the new Colab notebook.

9. Develop a strategy to ensure a perfect score on the thesis evaluation and grading rubric.

10. Throughout the outline, maintain a balance between theoretical background, practical examples, and your own position/argument.

11. Evaluate your proposed outline based on the grading rubric. For each aspect of the rubric, note where and how it is covered, in a table.

When creating your improved outline, interpret, consider and discuss the following syntax notes:

fig-alt="FLOWCHART: Five-step automation pipeline workflow for AMTAIR project.

DATA: The pipeline transforms PDFs through ArgDown, BayesDown, CSV, and HTML into Bayesian network visualizations.

PURPOSE: Illustrates the core technical process that enables automated extraction of probabilistic models from AI safety literature.

DETAILS: Five numbered green steps show: (1) LLM-based extraction from PDFs to ArgDown, (2) ArgDown to BayesDown completion with probabilities, (3) Extracting world-models as CSV data, (4) Software tools for data inference, and (5) Visualization of the resulting Bayesian network.

Each step includes example outputs, with the final visualization showing a Rain-Sprinkler-Grass Wet Bayesian network with probability tables.

For each section and subsection, provide detailed bullet points that cover the content to be included.

Ensure that you integrate technical explanations, code snippets, and examples where appropriate.

Your final output should be a comprehensive, annotated outline that and includes:

1. Detailed bullet points for each section and subsection

2. Clear indications of where code examples and technical explanations will be included

3. Suggestions for maintaining coherence and flow throughout the thesis

4. Suggestions for citations (both good, applicable sources and claims that need references) - in "> Blockquote formatting"

Present your final outline within <final_outline> tags.



To tailor the improved thesis outline precisely, could you please confirm or clarify the following:

1. **Full Thesis Title or Tentative Working Title** – so the outline and framing match.
    
2. **Central Thesis Question or Argument** – Is the focus mainly normative (e.g., how to govern AI) or technical (e.g., methods to model AI risks)?
    
3. **Your intended contribution** – Are you primarily developing a methodology (e.g., AMTAIR) or making a philosophical/economic argument about its utility?
    
4. **Targeted philosophers/economists or debates** you aim to engage with explicitly (e.g., Bostrom, Ord, Hanson, MIRI, epistemic decision theory, etc.).
    
5. **Are there specific formal frameworks** (e.g., Bayesian epistemology, causal inference, decision theory) you want to center?
    
6. **Deadline and target length** for the final thesis (e.g., 60–80 pages?).
    
7. Should we assume Quarto/LaTeX formatting for figures, citations, and cross-references?
    

Once I have this context, I’ll proceed with a deeply integrated, rubric-aligned, technically grounded outline.
