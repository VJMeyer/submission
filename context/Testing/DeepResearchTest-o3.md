# Thesis Overview – _Automating the Modelling of Transformative Artificial Intelligence Risks_

## Thesis Title

The thesis is currently titled _Automating the Modelling of Transformative Artificial Intelligence Risks_. The subtitle further clarifies the focus: _“An Epistemic Framework for Leveraging Frontier AI Systems to Upscale Conditional Policy Assessments in Bayesian Networks on a Narrow Path towards Existencial Safety”_[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/latex/title-page.tex#L24-L32)[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/latex/title-page.tex#L34-L38). This full title encapsulates the project’s aim of automating risk modeling for transformative AI, emphasizing an epistemic framework that leverages advanced AI systems and Bayesian networks in service of existential safety.

## Central Research Question

The central research question posed by the thesis asks whether frontier AI technologies can be used to automate the modeling of transformative AI risks in order to predict policy outcomes. In the author’s words: **“How can frontier AI technologies be utilized to automate the extraction of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature, enabling robust prediction of policy impacts?”**[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/context/PY_Thesis_OutlineNDraft.md#L2-L5). This question highlights the core goal of using today’s most advanced AI (e.g. GPT-4 level language models) to formalize the arguments and worldviews in AI safety research, and then using those formal models (probabilistic _world models_) to evaluate how different governance interventions might change the probabilities of catastrophic outcomes[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/chapters/Intro/Intro1.md#L25-L33).

## Intended Contributions (Methodology, Epistemic Framing, Policy Relevance)

The thesis is designed to make contributions on multiple levels – methodologically, epistemically, and in practical policy terms:

- **Methodology:** It introduces a novel computational pipeline and set of tools for _quantifying AI risk and formalizing world models_. In academic terms, the work _“introduc[es] novel methodologies for quantifying risks and formalizing world models”_[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/context/PY_ThesisOverviewCD.md#L13-L16). Concretely, this involves automating the conversion of argumentative text into Bayesian network models (via formats like ArgDown/BayesDown), thereby scaling up the Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) approach with AI-driven methods.
    
- **Epistemic Framing:** The project provides a unifying _epistemic framework_ for AI governance discourse. In fact, the thesis explicitly frames itself as an epistemic infrastructure for integrating diverse expert perspectives. The subtitle calls it an _“Epistemic Framework for leveraging frontier AI systems”_ to formalize assumptions and arguments[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/latex/title-page.tex#L34-L38). By representing different viewpoints in a common formal language (Bayesian networks with probabilities), the research creates a shared **world model** that makes implicit assumptions explicit and comparable. This helps bridge gaps between disciplines by bringing various arguments into one probabilistic knowledge framework.
    
- **Policy Relevance:** A key practical contribution is to equip policymakers and strategists with better decision-support tools. The thesis produces a working system (a kind of “P(Doom) calculator”) that policymakers can use to test how certain policy interventions might influence the likelihood of existential catastrophe[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/chapters/Intro/Intro1.md#L34-L38). In the author’s formulation, the work _practically offers policymakers tools_ to navigate AI governance complexities[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/context/PY_ThesisOverviewCD.md#L13-L16) – for example, interactive Bayesian network visualizations that show the projected impact of different policy scenarios. The ultimate aim is to improve real-world decision-making about AI risks by providing rigorous, scenario-based policy assessment mechanisms.
    

## Intended Audience

The thesis is written for both immediate academic evaluators and a broader scholarly/policy community:

- **Academic Examiners:** First and foremost, the direct audience includes the thesis committee at University of Bayreuth – for example, the supervisor Dr. Timo Speith[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/latex/title-page.tex#L70-L73) and other Philosophy & Economics faculty who will evaluate the work. The content is tailored to meet the Master’s program standards (as reflected in the grading rubric), ensuring clarity and completeness for academic readers.
    
- **AI Safety & Governance Researchers:** The work is meant to speak to the interdisciplinary AI safety/AI governance research community. It addresses the “coordination crisis” between technical AI researchers, policy analysts, ethicists, and strategists[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/chapters/Intro/Intro1.md#L9-L18), and provides a framework that integrates their perspectives. Thus, scholars interested in **AI risk modeling, Bayesian reasoning, argumentation, and policy analysis** are a key audience. The project explicitly aims to facilitate communication between _technical AI researchers and governance/policy experts_ by creating a shared modeling language[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/context/PY_AMTAIRDescription.md#L36-L42). It also draws on prior work by the MTAIR team (Manheim et al.), indicating those researchers and the broader x-risk academic community are intended readers.
    
- **Policymakers and Strategists:** Given the thesis’ applied focus, it is also directed at policymakers and strategic thinkers concerned with AI risks. The tools and findings are presented in a way that can inform policy decisions. For instance, one stated impact is _“enhancing decision-making for policymakers”_ by providing a structured framework for assessing policy impacts across scenarios[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/context/PY_AMTAIRDescription.md#L34-L41). While the thesis remains an academic work, its relevance to real-world policy means that AI governance institutions and think tanks (and individuals therein) form an important part of the intended audience.
    
- **Generally Interested Readers:** The thesis is written to be accessible to an “intelligent and interested” reader who may _not_ have prior specialized knowledge of the subject[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/chapters/Frontmatter.qmd#L72-L76). All necessary terminology is introduced and explained, and the document avoids assuming extensive background. This means the text could be read by anyone with a general interest in AI governance or risk modeling, not just experts – a deliberate choice to maximize clarity and impact across disciplines.
    

## Formal Frameworks Used

The thesis builds upon several formal frameworks and methodologies, both explicitly and implicitly:

- **Bayesian Networks (Probabilistic Graphical Models):** At its core, the project uses Bayesian networks as the formal representation of knowledge about AI risk. A Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent propositions/variables and edges encode probabilistic dependencies (often causal relationships). The thesis explicitly adopts this framework – _“Bayesian networks serve as the formal representation of the modeled risks”_, with nodes and edges and associated conditional probability tables capturing the expert judgments[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/context/AMTAIR-FAQ_NotebookLM.md#L15-L19). This reflects a **Bayesian epistemology** approach: uncertainties and beliefs are encoded as probabilities that can be updated with evidence. In essence, the thesis’s approach is quantitative and probabilistic, treating the problem of AI risk in terms of probabilistic inference and belief updating.
    
- **Argument Mapping and Informal Logic (ArgDown/BayesDown):** To bridge natural-language arguments with the Bayesian formalism, the thesis utilizes **ArgDown**, a markdown-based argument mapping language, and its extended probabilistic version **BayesDown**. These frameworks come from the informal logic/argumentation domain and allow the structured capture of premises, conclusions, and support/attack relations in text form. The project automates the transformation of arguments written in ArgDown/BayesDown into Bayesian network form[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/context/AMTAIR-FAQ_NotebookLM.md#L6-L9). This integration means the thesis implicitly relies on principles of structured argumentation and informal logic – taking qualitative argument structures and then **quantifying** them. By _“leverag[ing] the strengths of both: structured logical relationships from ArgDown and quantitative probabilistic dependencies in Bayesian Networks”_[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/context/AMTAIR-FAQ_NotebookLM.md#L6-L9), the work stands on a blend of argumentation theory and probabilistic modeling.
    
- **Scenario Forecasting and Prediction Markets:** The methodology incorporates elements of forecasting and futures modeling, notably by integrating **live prediction market data** into the risk models. In other words, the Bayesian networks can be informed or updated with real-world predictive signals (e.g. forecasts about AI progress or risk, drawn from platforms where forecasters bet on outcomes). The thesis proposal describes combining Bayesian networks, DAG models, _“and live forecasting data to create dynamic, adaptive models for strategic decision-making”_[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/context/PY_ThesisOverviewCD.md#L17-L25). This aligns with scenario forecasting frameworks – using external predictive inputs to explore different future scenarios. It builds on ideas like forecasting trees and probabilistic trend analysis to ensure the models remain calibrated to current best forecasts about AI development trajectories[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/context/PY_ThesisOverviewCD.md#L33-L40). By integrating these techniques, the thesis implicitly uses principles of **predictive modeling** and crowd-based forecasting to strengthen its analysis.
    
- **Causal Inference (Intervention Modeling):** Because the thesis is concerned with how policy _interventions_ influence outcomes, it engages with causal inference concepts. The Bayesian networks are not just descriptive but are used to evaluate _counterfactuals_ (e.g. “if policy X is implemented, how does the probability of disaster change?”). This implies a causal interpretation of the DAG edges and the use of do-interventions or conditional probability queries akin to causal reasoning. In the thesis, _“policy impact prediction”_ specifically means _“evaluating how governance interventions might alter the probability distribution of outcomes”_[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/chapters/Intro/Intro1.md#L30-L37). This is effectively a causal inference exercise within the Bayesian network framework. While the thesis may not delve into formal do-calculus notation, it uses the intuition of causal Bayesian networks to simulate and compare scenarios. Thus, frameworks from **causal analysis** (treatment of nodes as causes/effects, sensitivity and scenario analysis, etc.) are an implicit foundation of the approach.
    

In summary, the work stands on a combination of **Bayesian probability theory**, **argumentation logic**, **forecasting methods**, and **causal modeling**. It explicitly implements ArgDown/BayesDown to capture arguments, uses Bayesian networks to formalize uncertain reasoning, and integrates forecasting data – thereby spanning multiple formal frameworks to achieve its goals.

## Target Length and Deadline

- **Length:** The thesis is expected to be roughly **30,000 words** in length. The title page and metadata confirm a target word count of about 30k words[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/latex/title-page.tex#L70-L73)[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/thesis.qmd#L50-L53), which is in line with typical MA thesis requirements in the program.
    
- **Deadline:** The final submission deadline is **May 26, 2025**. This date is explicitly listed as the submission date in the thesis metadata and title page (26th of May, 2025)[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/thesis.qmd#L50-L53). All writing and revisions are aligned toward that end-of-May 2025 deadline for completion and evaluation.
    

## Technical Toolchain and Formatting Conventions

The thesis employs a modern academic writing toolchain, integrating several software and workflow components:

- **Quarto & LaTeX:** The thesis is authored in Quarto (an R-Markdown/RStudio affiliated framework for technical documents) using `.qmd` files, and it is compiled to PDF (and HTML) via LaTeX. The repository contains Quarto markdown source files (e.g. `thesis.qmd` and chapter `.qmd`/`.md` files) which are processed to produce the final document[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/thesis.qmd#L54-L60). Custom LaTeX files are used for elements like the title page and affidavit, ensuring the document meets university formatting requirements[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/chapters/Frontmatter.qmd#L108-L116). Quarto allows mixing Markdown with LaTeX as needed – for example, references are handled through Pandoc/Quarto and rendered in a specific style (in this thesis, references are placed in the margin, as indicated by the Quarto configuration)[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/thesis.qmd#L54-L60).
    
- **Zotero & BibTeX for References:** The reference management is done via a BibTeX database, likely maintained through Zotero. The repository’s `ref/MAref.bib` file contains the bibliography entries, which suggests the author used Zotero (with Better BibTeX) to collect and export sources[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/thesis.qmd#L54-L60). Citations in the text follow an author-year format (e.g. “(Author, 2023)”), consistent with the Philosophy & Economics program’s guidelines[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/context/GradingRubric.md#L12-L14). Quarto/Pandoc then automatically formats these citations and generates the reference list from the `.bib` file.
    
- **Obsidian for Note-Taking and Drafting:** The author’s workflow included Obsidian (a knowledge base and markdown editor) for organizing notes, outline drafts, and contextual materials. Evidence of this is seen in the repository, which contains context files with Obsidian vault links (e.g. files prefixed `PY_...` that include `obsidian://` URIs)[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/context/PY_ThesisOverviewCD.md#L2-L5). This suggests that the thesis outline and content were developed using Obsidian for note management, then exported or integrated into the Quarto project. The use of Obsidian allowed the author to interlink ideas, maintain a zettelkasten-style vault of research notes, and iteratively refine the thesis content before final compilation.
    
- **Citation and Bibliography Style:** The thesis follows an author–date citation style (a form of Harvard/APA style). In-text citations are given in parentheses with author name and year, and the full bibliography with complete references is included at the end. The grading rubric explicitly requires consistent (Author, Year) citations and a complete reference list[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/context/GradingRubric.md#L12-L14), which the thesis implements. Additionally, Quarto’s configuration in this project places citations in the document margin for the PDF version[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/thesis.qmd#L56-L60), which is a stylistic choice to improve readability (often inspired by Tufte-style formatting).
    
- **Writing and Formatting Conventions:** The thesis adheres to clarity and accessibility guidelines in its writing style. The author was careful to introduce and define all technical terminology for the reader[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/chapters/Frontmatter.qmd#L72-L76). Sentences are kept reasonably short and in active voice, and paragraphs are focused on single ideas – these practices follow the “usual paper requirements” checklist provided to the author[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/chapters/Frontmatter.qmd#L78-L86). The document is structured with numbered sections corresponding to the required thesis outline (Introduction, Background, Methodology, etc.), and the structure was explicitly planned to match the percentage weightings of the grading rubric (e.g. ~10% of words for Introduction, ~20% for Background, etc., as seen in the source files)[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/chapters/Introduction.qmd#L10-L18)[github.com](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission/blob/ec7fcfd88d3be05b4e0b67133dcc0de12e5e8913/chapters/Context.qmd#L11-L19). The use of Quarto also facilitated including figures and ensuring consistency in formatting. Overall, the toolchain (Quarto+LaTeX+Obsidian+Zotero) and the adopted style conventions were chosen to produce a well-organized, polished thesis that meets academic standards and is easy to navigate and understand.
    

Each of these elements – from the automation-centric content to the modern writing workflow – contributes to a thesis that is methodologically rigorous, epistemically innovative, policy-relevant, and presented in a clear, professional format. All assertions above are corroborated by the thesis repository contents, ensuring the synthesized answers align with the documented plans and drafts in Valentin Meyer’s project.

Correct, now please proceed by creating the exceptionally high-quality, annotated outline to the specifications provided before:
<previous_prompt>


</previous_prompt>


To finalize the outline precisely, could you confirm:

1. Should the thesis be divided into numbered chapters with formal sections (e.g. 1 Introduction, 2 Background...)?
    
2. Do you want each section annotated with specific source links from your GitHub repo (e.g. to drafts or figures), or should we only annotate content at the conceptual level?
    
3. Should all code examples (e.g. from the Rain-Sprinkler-Colab) be embedded inline, or moved to appendices and cross-referenced?
    

This will ensure the outline is optimally structured for your thesis workflow and formatting in Quarto.



1. Yes the thesis is divided into chapters:
	1. Introduction
	2. Context & Background
		1. Theoretical Foundations
		2. Methodology
	3. AMTAIR Implementation
		1. Software Implementation (incl. Colab Notebook)
		2. Results
	4. Discussion
	5. Conclusion
2. The specific github links will be added later, but annotate both on the conceptual level as well as with the specific contents / "points which need to be mentioned"
3. Name code examples - the embedding will occur at a later stage.
   
Now please proceed by creating the exceptionally high-quality, annotated outline to the specifications provided before and refer to the github repository if any other questions arise!
