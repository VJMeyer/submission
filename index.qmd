# Quarto Syntax {#sec-syntax}

## Main Formatting

### Html Comments

<!-- Comments for comments -->

### Tasks with ToDo Tree

`<!-- [ ] ToDos for things to do / tasks / reminders (allows "jump to with Taks Tree extension") -->`

<!-- [ ] ToDos for things to do / tasks / reminders (allows "jump to with Taks Tree extension") -->

### Verbatim Code Formatting

`verbatim code formatting for notes and ideas to be included (here)`

### Code Block formatting

```         
Also code blocks for more extensive notes and ideas to be included and checklists
- test 1. 
- test 2. 
- test 3.
2. second
3. third
```

```
code
```

Add a language to syntax highlight code blocks:


```python
1 + 1
```

### Blockquote Formatting

> Blockquote formatting for "Suggested Citations (e.g. carlsmith 2024 on ...)" and/or claims which require a citation (e.g. claim x should be backed-up by a ciation from the literature)

### Tables

| Right | Left | Default | Center |
|------:|:-----|---------|:------:|
|   12  |  12  |    12   |    12  |
|  123  |  123 |   123   |   123  |
|    1  |    1 |     1   |     1  |

| Col1 | Col2 | Col3 |
|------|------|------|
| A    | B    | C    |
| E    | F    | G    |
| A    | G    | G    |

## Headings & Potential Headings in Standard Markdown formatting ('\##') {#sec-heading}

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

<!-- ##### Heading 5 -->

<!-- ###### Heading 6 -->


## Text Formatting Options

*italics*, **bold**, ***bold italics***

superscript^2^ 
and  subscript~2~

~~strikethrough~~

[This text is highlighted]{.mark}

[This text is underlined]{.underline}

[This text is smallcaps]{.smallcaps}

## Lists

-   unordered list

    -   sub-item 1
    -   sub-item 2
        -   sub-sub-item 1

-   item 2

    Continued (indent 4 spaces)

1.  ordered list
2.  item 2
    i)  sub-item 1
        A.  sub-sub-item 1

## Math

inline math: $E = mc^{2}$

display math:

$$E = mc^{2}$$

If you want to define custom TeX macros, include them within \$\$ delimiters enclosed in a .hidden block. For example:

::: hidden
$$
 \def\RR{{\bf R}}
 \def\bold#1{{\bf #1}}
$$
:::

For HTML math processed using MathJax (the default) you can use the \\def, \\newcommand, \\renewcommand, \\newenvironment, \\renewenvironment, and \\let commands to create your own macros and environments.

## Footnotes

Here is an inline note.[^1]

[^1]: Inlines notes are easier to write, since you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the note.

Here is a footnote reference,[^2]

[^2]: Here is the footnote.

Another Text with a footnote[^3] but this time a "longnote".

[^3]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they belong to the previous footnote.

    ```         
    { some.code }
    ```

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first line. In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it isn't indented.

## Callouts {#sec-callouts}

Quarto's native callouts work without additional packages:

::: note
This is written in a 'note' environment -- but it does not seem to produce any special rendering.
:::

::: callout-note
### Optional Title

Content here
:::

::: callout-note
### Important Note2

This renders perfectly in both HTML and PDF.
:::

Also for markdown:

``` markdown
::: {.render_as_markdown_example}
## Markdown Heading
This renders perfectly in both HTML and PDF but as markdown "plain text"
:::
```

## Reference or Embed Code from .ipynb files

#### Code chunks from .ipynb notebooks can be embedded in the .qmd text with:

``` markdown
{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#my_code_cell_test >}}
```

#### which produces the output of executing the code cell:

{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#my_code_cell_test >}}

#### including 'echo=true' renders the code of the cell:

``` markdown
{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#my_code_cell_test echo=true >}}
```

{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#my_code_cell_test echo=true >}}

Full Notebooks are embedded in the Appendix through the \_quarto.yml file with:

## Diagrams

Quarto has native support for embedding Mermaid and Graphviz diagrams. This enables you to create flowcharts, sequence diagrams, state diagrams, Gantt charts, and more using a plain text syntax inspired by markdown.

For example, here we embed a flowchart created using Mermaid:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Hard edge] --> B(Round edge)
  B --> C{Decision}
  C --> D[Result one]
  C --> E[Result two]
```

## Citations {#sec-citations .unnumbered .unlisted}

@soares2014 <!-- preferred because it works with both html, latex and pdf -->

[@soares2014] and [@knuth1984]

Blah Blah [see @knuth1984, pp. 33-35; also @growiec2024, chap. 1]

### Narrative citations (author as subject)

@soares2014 argues that AI alignment requires...

### Parenthetical citations (supporting reference)

Recent work supports this view [@soares2014; @knuth1984].

### Author-only citation (when discussing the person)

As [-@soares2014] demonstrates in their analysis...

### Year-only citation (when author already mentioned)

Soares [-@soares2014] later revised this position.

### Page-specific references

The key insight appears in [@soares2014, pp. 45-67].

### Multiple works, different pages

This view is supported [@soares2014, p. 23; @knuth1984, pp. 156-159].

## Section Cross-References {#sec-crossref}

Refer to sections like: @sec-adaptive-governance and @sec-crossref <!-- Using @-sec-REFERENCE_HEADING requires that the .qmd file contains a yml section which details the "numbering" -->

``` markdown
Caveat: refering to sections with @sec-HEADINGS works only for sections with:
## Heading {#sec-HEADINGS}
It does not work for sections with ".unnumbered and/or .unlisted":
## Heading {#sec-HEADINGS .unnumbered .unlisted}
Furthermore the .qmd and/or .md yml settings (~ numbering have to be just right)
```

### Section Numbers

By default, all headings in your document create a numbered section. You customize numbering depth using the number-depth option. For example, to only number sections immediately below the chapter level, use this:

`number-depth: 2`

Note that toc-depth is independent of number-depth (i.e. you can have unnumbered entries in the TOC if they are masked out from numbering by number-depth).

# Abstract {#sec-abstract}

```{=html}
<!-- A concise overview highlighting the project's integration of frontier AI, Bayesian networks, and prediction markets to create a scalable framework for evaluating AI governance policies.
Emphasize both technical contributions and policy relevance. -->
```

> The coordination crisis in AI governance presents a paradoxical challenge: unprecedented investment in AI safety coexists alongside fundamental coordination failures across technical, policy, and ethical domains. These divisions systematically increase existential risk. This thesis introduces AMTAIR (Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling), a computational approach addressing this coordination failure by automating the extraction of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature using frontier language models. The system implements an end-to-end pipeline transforming unstructured text into interactive Bayesian networks through a novel two-stage extraction process that bridges communication gaps between stakeholders.

`The coordination crisis in AI governance presents a paradoxical challenge: unprecedented investment in AI safety coexists alongside fundamental coordination failures across technical, policy, and ethical domains. These divisions systematically increase existential risk by creating safety gaps, misallocating resources, and fostering inconsistent approaches to interdependent problems.`

> This thesis introduces AMTAIR (Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling), a computational approach that addresses this coordination failure by automating the extraction of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature using frontier language models.

`The AMTAIR system implements an end-to-end pipeline that transforms unstructured text into interactive Bayesian networks through a novel two-stage extraction process: first capturing argument structure in ArgDown format, then enhancing it with probability information in BayesDown. This approach bridges communication gaps between stakeholders by making implicit models explicit, enabling comparison across different worldviews, providing a common language for discussing probabilistic relationships, and supporting policy evaluation across diverse scenarios.`
