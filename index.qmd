## For Callouts

Quarto's native callouts work without additional packages:


:::note
Remember to connect this back to the research question
:::


::: {.callout-note}
## Optional Title
Content here
:::
::: {.callout-note}
## Important Note2
This renders perfectly in both HTML and PDF.2
:::

Also for markdown:

```markdown
::: {.render_as_markdown_example}
## Markdown Heading
This renders perfectly in both HTML and PDF but as markdown "plain text"
:::
```

## Section Cross-References {#sec-crossref}

Refer to sections like: @sec-adaptive-governance and @sec-crossref
<!-- Using @-sec-REFERENCE_HEADING requires that the .qmd file contains a yml section which details the "numbering" -->

```markdown
Caveat: refering to sections with @sec-HEADINGS works only for sections with:
## Heading {#sec-HEADINGS}
It does not work for sections with ".unnumbered and/or .unlisted":
## Heading {#sec-HEADINGS .unnumbered .unlisted}
```


## Reference or Embed Code from .ipynb files

#### Code chunks from .ipynb notebooks can be embedded in the .qmd text with:

```markdown
{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#my_code_cell_test >}}
```
#### which produces the output of executing the code cell:

{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#my_code_cell_test >}}

#### including 'echo=true' renders the code of the cell:

```markdown
{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#my_code_cell_test echo=true >}}
```

{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#my_code_cell_test echo=true >}}

          DATA: The pipeline transforms PDFs through ArgDown, BayesDown, CSV, and HTML into Bayesian network visualizations.
          PURPOSE: Illustrates the core technical process that enables automated extraction of probabilistic models from AI safety literature.
          DETAILS: Five numbered green steps show: (1) LLM-based extraction from PDFs to ArgDown, (2) ArgDown to BayesDown completion with probabilities, (3) Extracting world-models as CSV data, (4) Software tools for data inference, and (5) Visualization of the resulting Bayesian network.
          Each step includes example outputs, with the final visualization showing a Rain-Sprinkler-Grass Wet Bayesian network with probability tables.

# Abstract {#sec-abstract}


<!-- A concise overview highlighting the project's integration of frontier AI, Bayesian networks, and prediction markets to create a scalable framework for evaluating AI governance policies.
Emphasize both technical contributions and policy relevance. -->

> The coordination crisis in AI governance presents a paradoxical challenge: unprecedented investment in AI safety coexists alongside fundamental coordination failures across technical, policy, and ethical domains. These divisions systematically increase existential risk. This thesis introduces AMTAIR (Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling), a computational approach addressing this coordination failure by automating the extraction of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature using frontier language models. The system implements an end-to-end pipeline transforming unstructured text into interactive Bayesian networks through a novel two-stage extraction process that bridges communication gaps between stakeholders.

<!-- [ ] Write comprehensive abstract capturing coordination crisis, technical contribution, and policy implications -->

`The coordination crisis in AI governance presents a paradoxical challenge: unprecedented investment in AI safety coexists alongside fundamental coordination failures across technical, policy, and ethical domains. These divisions systematically increase existential risk by creating safety gaps, misallocating resources, and fostering inconsistent approaches to interdependent problems.`

> This thesis introduces AMTAIR (Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling), a computational approach that addresses this coordination failure by automating the extraction of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature using frontier language models.

`The AMTAIR system implements an end-to-end pipeline that transforms unstructured text into interactive Bayesian networks through a novel two-stage extraction process: first capturing argument structure in ArgDown format, then enhancing it with probability information in BayesDown. This approach bridges communication gaps between stakeholders by making implicit models explicit, enabling comparison across different worldviews, providing a common language for discussing probabilistic relationships, and supporting policy evaluation across diverse scenarios.`
