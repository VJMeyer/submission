# Discussion		—	Exchange, Controversy & Influence

## Challenges & Problems	—	Red Teaming Problems, Failures & Downsides

	Potential Failures:

* Data Issues: Inaccurate or biased inputs.  
* Model Limitations: Oversimplifications.  
* Tech Risks: AI misinterpretations.

	Red Teaming:

* Stress-testing models to find weaknesses.

	Impact on Theory of Change:

* Identifying points of failure strengthens the approach.

## Implications & Impact	—	Uptake, Feedback Loops, Uptake & Success – Green Teaming –

	Potential Outcomes:

* First-Order: Reduced AI risks through better policies.  
* Second-Order: Enhanced collaboration.  
* Third-Order: Framework applied to other global risks.

	Feedback Loops:

* Continuous model improvement.  
* Adaptive policy-making.

	Green Teaming:

* Strategies to maximize positive impacts.

## Known Unknowns & Unknown Unknowns	—	Input Data Example:	Modeling Author Worldviews from Bibliographies Instead of Individual Papers

	Potential Outcomes:

* First-Order: Reduced AI risks through better policies.  
* Second-Order: Enhanced collaboration.  
* Third-Order: Framework applied to other global risks.

	Feedback Loops:

* Continuous model improvement.  
* Adaptive policy-making.

	Green Teaming:

* Strategies to maximize positive impacts.


## Discussion: Implications and Limitations

#### Red-Teaming Results: Identifying Failure Modes

<!-- Present results from systematic attempts to find weaknesses in the approach, including data biases, model limitations, and inference failures. Discuss implications for the reliability of the system's outputs. -->

#### Enhancing Epistemic Security in AI Governance

<!-- Analyze how formal modeling can improve the quality of discourse in AI governance by making assumptions explicit, clarifying disagreements, and highlighting critical uncertainties. -->

#### Scaling Challenges and Opportunities

<!-- Discuss both technical and organizational challenges to scaling the approach, including computational requirements, data quality issues, and coordination mechanisms. Identify opportunities for further development. -->

#### Integration with Existing Governance Frameworks

<!-- Examine how the modeling approach could complement existing AI governance initiatives, including technical standards, regulatory frameworks, and international coordination mechanisms. -->

#### Known Unknowns and Deep Uncertainties

<!-- Acknowledge fundamental limitations of the approach, particularly regarding novel or unprecedented developments in AI that might fall outside the model's structure. Discuss strategies for maintaining model relevance despite deep uncertainty. -->
