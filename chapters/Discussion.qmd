# Discussion		—	Exchange, Controversy & Influence

## Challenges & Problems	—	Red Teaming Problems, Failures & Downsides

	Potential Failures:

* Data Issues: Inaccurate or biased inputs.  
* Model Limitations: Oversimplifications.  
* Tech Risks: AI misinterpretations.

	Red Teaming:

* Stress-testing models to find weaknesses.

	Impact on Theory of Change:

* Identifying points of failure strengthens the approach.

## Implications & Impact	—	Uptake, Feedback Loops, Uptake & Success – Green Teaming –

	Potential Outcomes:

* First-Order: Reduced AI risks through better policies.  
* Second-Order: Enhanced collaboration.  
* Third-Order: Framework applied to other global risks.

	Feedback Loops:

* Continuous model improvement.  
* Adaptive policy-making.

	Green Teaming:

* Strategies to maximize positive impacts.

## Known Unknowns & Unknown Unknowns	—	Input Data Example:	Modeling Author Worldviews from Bibliographies Instead of Individual Papers

	Potential Outcomes:

* First-Order: Reduced AI risks through better policies.
