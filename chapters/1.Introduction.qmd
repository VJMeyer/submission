## The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance {#sec-coordination-crisis}

<!-- [ ] Frame the problem as coordination failure rather than merely technical challenge -->

<!-- [ ] Document how fragmentation systematically increases risk through safety gaps, resource misallocation, and negative-sum dynamics -->

As AI capabilities advance at an accelerating pace—demonstrated by the rapid progression from GPT-3 to GPT-4, Claude, and beyond—we face a governance challenge unlike any in human history: how to ensure increasingly powerful AI systems remain aligned with human values and beneficial to humanity's long-term flourishing. This challenge becomes particularly acute when considering the possibility of transformative AI systems that could drastically alter civilization's trajectory, potentially including existential risks from misaligned systems.

> Despite unprecedented investment in AI safety research, rapidly growing awareness among key stakeholders, and proliferating frameworks for responsible AI development, we face what I'll term the "coordination crisis" in AI governance—a systemic failure to align diverse efforts across technical, policy, and strategic domains into a coherent response proportionate to the risks we face.

\`The AI governance landscape exhibits a peculiar paradox: extraordinary activity alongside fundamental coordination failure. Consider the current state of affairs:

Technical safety researchers develop increasingly sophisticated alignment techniques, but often without clear implementation pathways to deployment contexts. Policy specialists craft principles and regulatory frameworks without sufficient technical grounding to ensure their practical efficacy. Ethicists articulate normative principles that lack operational specificity. Strategy researchers identify critical uncertainties but struggle to translate these into actionable guidance.\`

This thesis addresses a specific dimension of the coordination challenge by investigating the question: **Can frontier AI technologies be utilized to automate the modeling of transformative AI risks, enabling robust prediction of policy impacts?**

`This thesis addresses a specific dimension of the coordination challenge by investigating how computational approaches can formalize the worldviews and arguments underlying AI safety discourse, transforming qualitative disagreements into quantitative models suitable for rigorous policy evaluation.`

To break this down into its components:

-   **Frontier AI Technologies**: Today's most capable language models (GPT-4, Claude-3 level systems)
-   **Automated Modeling**: Using these systems to extract and formalize argument structures from natural language
-   **Transformative AI Risks**: Potentially catastrophic outcomes from advanced AI systems, particularly existential risks
-   **Policy Impact Prediction**: Evaluating how governance interventions might alter probability distributions over outcomes

**Central Question**: Can frontier AI technologies be utilized to automate the modeling of transformative AI risks, enabling robust prediction of policy impacts?

`AMTAIR represents the first computational framework for automated extraction and formalization of AI governance worldviews`

**Core Innovation**:

-   Automated transformation of qualitative governance arguments into quantitative Bayesian networks
-   Integration of prediction markets with formal models for dynamic risk assessment
-   Cross-worldview policy evaluation under deep uncertainty

**Scope Boundaries:**

<!-- [ ] Establish clear boundaries and justify the focused approach -->

`The investigation encompasses both theoretical development and practical implementation, focusing specifically on existential risks from misaligned AI systems rather than broader AI ethics concerns. This narrowed scope enables deep technical development while addressing the highest-stakes coordination challenges.`

The scope encompasses both theoretical development and practical implementation. Theoretically, I develop a framework for representing diverse perspectives on AI risk in a common formal language. Practically, I implement this framework in a computational system—the AI Risk Pathway Analyzer (ARPA)—that enables interactive exploration of how policy interventions might alter existential risk.

## The Multiplicative Benefits Framework {#sec-multiplicative-benefits}

<!-- [ ] Establish central thesis about synergistic combination of three elements -->

<!-- [ ] Include causal diagram visualizing how components interact -->

<!-- [ ] Provide concrete examples of multiplicative effects across domains -->

**Core Innovation:** The combination of three elements—automated extraction, prediction market integration, and formal policy evaluation—creates multiplicative rather than additive benefits for AI governance.

The central thesis of this work is that combining three elements—automated worldview extraction, prediction market integration, and formal policy evaluation—creates multiplicative rather than merely additive benefits for AI governance. Each component enhances the others, creating a system more valuable than the sum of its parts.

**Automated worldview extraction** using frontier language models addresses the scaling bottleneck in current approaches to AI risk modeling. The Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project demonstrated the value of formal representation but required extensive manual effort to translate qualitative arguments into quantitative models. Automation enables processing orders of magnitude more content, incorporating diverse perspectives, and maintaining models in near real-time as new arguments emerge.

**Prediction market integration** grounds these models in collective forecasting intelligence. By connecting formal representations to live forecasting platforms, the system can incorporate timely judgments about critical uncertainties from calibrated forecasters. This creates a dynamic feedback loop, where models inform forecasters and forecasts update models.

**Formal policy evaluation** transforms static risk assessments into actionable guidance by modeling how specific interventions might alter critical parameters. This enables conditional forecasting—understanding not just the probability of adverse outcomes but how those probabilities change under different policy regimes.

**Synergistic Components:**

1.  **Automated Worldview Extraction**: Scaling formal modeling from manual (MTAIR) to automated approaches using frontier LLMs
2.  **Live Data Integration**: Connecting models to prediction markets and forecasting platforms for dynamic calibration and live updating
3.  **Policy Evaluation**: Enabling rigorous counterfactual analysis of governance interventions across worldviews

`The synergy emerges because automation enables comprehensive data integration, markets inform and validate models, and evaluation gains precision from both automated extraction and market-based calibration.`

`The combination creates multiplicative rather than additive value—automation enables comprehensive data integration, markets inform models, evaluation gains precision from both`

## Thesis Structure and Roadmap {#sec-roadmap}

<!-- [ ] Preview the logical progression of the thesis -->

<!-- [ ] Explain how each section builds on previous ones -->

<!-- [ ] Provide reading guidance for different stakeholders -->

<!-- [ ] Provide clear navigation through the argument with reading guidance -->

**Logical Progression from Theory to Application:**

-   **Context & Background**: Establish theoretical foundations (Bayesian networks, argument mapping) and methodological approach (two-stage extraction)
-   **AMTAIR Implementation**: Demonstrate technical feasibility through working prototype with validated examples
-   **Critical Analysis**: Examine limitations, failure modes, and governance implications through systematic red-teaming
-   **Future Directions**: Connect to broader coordination challenges and research agenda

`Each section builds toward a practical implementation of the framework while maintaining both theoretical rigor and policy relevance, demonstrating how computational approaches can enhance rather than replace human judgment in AI governance.`

The remainder of this thesis develops the multiplicative benefits framework from theoretical foundations to practical implementation, following a progression from abstract principles to concrete applications:

Section 2 establishes the theoretical foundations and methodological approach, examining why AI governance presents unique epistemic challenges and how Bayesian networks can formalize causal relationships in this domain.

Section 3 presents the AMTAIR implementation, detailing the technical system that transforms qualitative arguments into formal representations. It demonstrates the approach through two case studies: the canonical Rain-Sprinkler-Lawn example and the more complex Carlsmith model of power-seeking AI.

Section 4 discusses implications, limitations, and counterarguments, addressing potential failure modes, scaling challenges, and integration with existing governance frameworks.

Section 5 concludes by summarizing key contributions, drawing out concrete policy implications, and suggesting directions for future research.

Throughout this progression, I maintain a dual focus on theoretical sophistication and practical utility. The framework aims not merely to advance academic understanding of AI risk but to provide actionable tools for improving coordination in AI governance.
