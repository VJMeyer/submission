### 20% of Grade:

- demonstrates understanding of all relevant core concepts

- explains why the question/thesis/problem is relevant in studentâ€™s own words (supported by quotations)

- situates it within the debate/course material

- reconstructs selected arguments and identifies relevant assumptions

- describes additional relevant material that has been consulted and integrates it with the course material as well as the research question/thesis/problem

  fig-alt="FLOWCHART: Five-step automation pipeline workflow for AMTAIR project.
          DATA: The pipeline transforms PDFs through ArgDown, BayesDown, CSV, and HTML into Bayesian network visualizations.
          PURPOSE: Illustrates the core technical process that enables automated extraction of probabilistic models from AI safety literature.
          DETAILS: Five numbered green steps show: (1) LLM-based extraction from PDFs to ArgDown, (2) ArgDown to BayesDown completion with probabilities, (3) Extracting world-models as CSV data, (4) Software tools for data inference, and (5) Visualization of the resulting Bayesian network.
          Each step includes example outputs, with the final visualization showing a Rain-Sprinkler-Grass Wet Bayesian network with probability tables.
