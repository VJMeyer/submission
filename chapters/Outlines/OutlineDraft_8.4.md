# **1\. Introduction: The AI Governance Challenge**

\<annotation\>This section sets the stage by establishing the coordination problem in AI governance as a critical risk factor, introducing the central research question, and outlining the thesis's approach. It should connect theoretical concerns with practical methodologies and preview the structure of the thesis.\</annotation\>

## **1.1 The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance**

*\<annotation\>Frame the problem as one of coordination failure rather than merely technical challenge. Describe how technical safety researchers, policy specialists, ethicists, and strategy researchers operate with different terminologies, priorities, and theories of change—creating fragmentation that systematically increases risk through safety gaps, resource misallocation, negative-sum dynamics, and capability-governance gaps.\</annotation\>*

As AI capabilities advance at an accelerating pace—demonstrated by the rapid progression from GPT-3 to GPT-4, Claude, and beyond—we face a governance challenge unlike any in human history: how to ensure increasingly powerful AI systems remain aligned with human values and beneficial to humanity's long-term flourishing. This challenge becomes particularly acute when considering the possibility of transformative AI systems that could drastically alter civilization's trajectory, potentially including existential risks from misaligned systems.

Yet despite unprecedented investment in AI safety research, rapidly growing awareness among key stakeholders, and proliferating frameworks for responsible AI development, we face what I'll term the "coordination crisis" in AI governance—a systemic failure to align diverse efforts across technical, policy, and strategic domains into a coherent response proportionate to the risks we face.

The AI governance landscape exhibits a peculiar paradox: extraordinary activity alongside fundamental coordination failure. Consider the current state of affairs:

Technical safety researchers develop increasingly sophisticated alignment techniques, but often without clear implementation pathways to deployment contexts. Policy specialists craft principles and regulatory frameworks without sufficient technical grounding to ensure their practical efficacy. Ethicists articulate normative principles that lack operational specificity. Strategy researchers identify critical uncertainties but struggle to translate these into actionable guidance. Each community operates with different terminologies, priorities, and implicit theories of change—a fragmentation that becomes exponentially more dangerous as capabilities approach and potentially exceed human-level intelligence.

This coordination gap isn't merely inefficient—it systematically increases risk through four mechanisms:

First, **safety gaps** emerge where different groups work with incompatible assumptions, creating blind spots that no single actor can see. When technical alignment researchers focus on formal verification while policy experts emphasize democratic oversight, the interface between these approaches may remain unaddressed.

Second, **resource misallocation** occurs as organizations duplicate efforts or invest in approaches that cannot scale to address the most critical challenges. The proliferation of ethics principles without corresponding verification mechanisms exemplifies this pattern.

Third, **negative-sum dynamics** emerge from locally optimized decisions that collectively reduce global safety. When labs compete to deploy increasingly capable systems without adequate safety measures, the result can be a race to the bottom that no participant individually desires.

Fourth, **capability-governance gaps** widen as the pace of AI advancement outstrips the development of corresponding governance mechanisms. The recent progression in frontier model capabilities has arguably outpaced even the formulation of governance questions, let alone answers.

The consequences of this coordination failure become more severe as capabilities advance, creating an urgent need for epistemic frameworks that can integrate diverse perspectives into coherent strategies. Traditional approaches to policy analysis—from cost-benefit analysis to scenario planning—prove inadequate when faced with the unique characteristics of advanced AI: unprecedented speed of development, technical complexity, mixed competitive and cooperative incentives, and fundamental uncertainty about future capabilities.

## **1.2 Research Question and Scope**

*\<annotation\>Clearly articulate the primary research question: "Can frontier AI technologies be utilized to automate the modeling of transformative AI risks, enabling robust prediction of policy impacts?" Define each component of the question precisely, establish boundaries of the investigation (focusing on existential risks from misaligned AI rather than other governance challenges), and note potential broader applications.\</annotation\>*

This thesis addresses a specific dimension of the coordination challenge by investigating the question: **Can frontier AI technologies be utilized to automate the modeling of transformative AI risks, enabling robust prediction of policy impacts?**

To break this down into its components:

* **Frontier AI technologies** refers to today's most capable AI systems (e.g., GPT-4 level large language models)  
* **Automation of modeling** involves using these systems to formalize the worldviews and arguments underlying AI safety discourse  
* **Transformative AI risks** focuses specifically on potentially catastrophic outcomes from advanced AI systems  
* **Policy impact prediction** refers to evaluating how governance interventions might alter the probability distribution of outcomes

The scope encompasses both theoretical development and practical implementation. Theoretically, I develop a framework for representing diverse perspectives on AI risk in a common formal language. Practically, I implement this framework in a computational system—the AI Risk Pathway Analyzer (ARPA)—that enables interactive exploration of how policy interventions might alter existential risk.

Several boundaries constrain this investigation. First, I focus specifically on existential risks from misaligned AI rather than other AI governance challenges such as bias, privacy, or economic disruption. Second, while I develop methods for extracting worldviews from written materials, I do not attempt to resolve fundamental disagreements between these perspectives. Third, I focus on formal modeling rather than political feasibility or implementation details of specific policies.

Despite these constraints, the approach has broad applicability beyond the specific implementation described here. The methods for automating worldview extraction, formalizing causal relationships, and evaluating conditional impacts could be adapted to other domains of existential risk or complex policy challenges more generally.

## **1.3 The Multiplicative Benefits Framework**

*\<annotation\>Establish the central thesis that the combination of (1) automated extraction, (2) prediction market integration, and (3) formal policy evaluation creates multiplicative rather than merely additive benefits for AI governance. Explain how each component enhances the others, creating a system more valuable than the sum of its parts—automation enables comprehensive prediction market integration, markets inform models, policy evaluation gains precision from both, etc.\</annotation\>*

The central thesis of this work is that combining three elements—automated worldview extraction, prediction market integration, and formal policy evaluation—creates multiplicative rather than merely additive benefits for AI governance. Each component enhances the others, creating a system more valuable than the sum of its parts.

**Automated worldview extraction** using frontier language models addresses the scaling bottleneck in current approaches to AI risk modeling. The Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project demonstrated the value of formal representation but required extensive manual effort to translate qualitative arguments into quantitative models. Automation enables processing orders of magnitude more content, incorporating diverse perspectives, and maintaining models in near real-time as new arguments emerge.

**Prediction market integration** grounds these models in collective forecasting intelligence. By connecting formal representations to live forecasting platforms, the system can incorporate timely judgments about critical uncertainties from calibrated forecasters. This creates a dynamic feedback loop, where models inform forecasters and forecasts update models.

**Formal policy evaluation** transforms static risk assessments into actionable guidance by modeling how specific interventions might alter critical parameters. This enables conditional forecasting—understanding not just the probability of adverse outcomes but how those probabilities change under different policy regimes.

The multiplicative effects emerge in several ways:

1. Automation makes comprehensive integration of prediction markets feasible, as manual approaches cannot process forecast data at scale.

2. Prediction markets become more informative when structured according to formal models that distinguish between crucial and irrelevant uncertainties.

3. Policy evaluation gains precision when informed by both comprehensive worldview modeling and calibrated forecasts about key parameters.

4. All components together enable sensitivity analysis that identifies which uncertainties most significantly influence outcomes, creating targeted opportunities for further research.

This framework bridges the gap between qualitative reasoning—the dominant mode in current AI governance discourse—and formal modeling necessary for rigorous evaluation of complex systems. It enables representing uncertainty explicitly, identifying cruxes of disagreement precisely, and evaluating interventions systematically.

## **1.4 From Theory to Practice: A Roadmap**

*\<annotation\>Preview the thesis structure, explaining how each section builds toward a practical implementation of the framework. Emphasize both theoretical rigor and practical utility, showing how the thesis aims not merely to advance academic understanding but to provide actionable tools for improving coordination in AI governance.\</annotation\>*

The remainder of this thesis develops the multiplicative benefits framework from theoretical foundations to practical implementation, following a progression from abstract principles to concrete applications:

Section 2 establishes the theoretical foundations, examining why AI governance presents unique epistemic challenges and how Bayesian networks can formalize causal relationships in this domain. It reviews relevant prior work, particularly the MTAIR project and Joe Carlsmith's analysis of power-seeking AI, to identify opportunities for automation and enhancement.

Section 3 presents the methodology, detailing how qualitative arguments can be systematically translated into formal representations. It explains the process of extracting causal structure, quantifying uncertainty, and integrating prediction market data into a cohesive modeling framework.

Section 4 describes the technical implementation of the AI Risk Pathway Analyzer (ARPA), including the automation pipeline, network construction and visualization components, inference engine, and policy evaluation interface. It explains design choices that balance theoretical rigor with practical usability.

Section 5 presents results from applying this framework to real-world AI governance questions. It evaluates the quality of automated extraction, demonstrates the system's capabilities through case studies, and analyzes how specific governance proposals affect risk assessments under different worldviews.

Section 6 critically examines the approach's limitations and broader implications, addressing potential failure modes, scaling challenges, and integration with existing governance frameworks. It considers both technical limitations and fundamental epistemic constraints.

Section 7 concludes by summarizing key contributions, drawing out concrete policy implications, and suggesting directions for future research.

Throughout this progression, I maintain a dual focus on theoretical sophistication and practical utility. The framework aims not merely to advance academic understanding of AI risk but to provide actionable tools for improving coordination in AI governance. By making implicit models explicit, identifying genuine points of disagreement, and evaluating interventions systematically, these tools can help bridge divides between technical, strategic, and policy communities working to ensure advanced AI benefits humanity.

At its core, this work represents a bet that the epistemic challenges in AI governance are not merely incidental but structural—and that addressing them requires not just more conversation but better tools for collective sensemaking. The stakes of this bet could hardly be higher, as coordinating our response to increasingly powerful AI systems may well determine humanity's long-term future.

# **4\. Implementation: AI Risk Pathway Analyzer (ARPA)**

The previous sections established both the need for improved coordination in AI governance and a theoretical framework for addressing this need through automated modeling of transformative AI risks. Here, we move from theory to practice, implementing key components of this framework in a concrete system: the AI Risk Pathway Analyzer (ARPA).

ARPA represents an instantiation of the multiplicative benefits framework described in Section 1.3, where automated extraction, formalized representation, and interactive analysis combine to create value greater than the sum of their parts. The implementation described here focuses on the core capabilities necessary to demonstrate this synergy: extracting structured representations from natural language texts, constructing formal Bayesian networks from these representations, and visualizing these networks in ways that make complex probabilistic relationships accessible to human interpretation.

It's worth noting that while the complete ARPA vision includes components for probabilistic inference, prediction market integration, and policy evaluation, the implementation described in this thesis focuses on the foundational extraction and representation pipeline. This foundation—transforming unstructured text into structured, visualizable Bayesian networks—represents the critical first step in automated risk modeling, upon which more sophisticated analysis capabilities can be built.

The implementation follows a modular architecture, with each component addressing a specific transformation in the pipeline from text to model. This modularity enables independent development and testing of components, clear separation of concerns, and the ability to extend the system incrementally as more sophisticated techniques become available. The following sections detail the system architecture, extraction pipeline, and network construction and visualization components that form the backbone of ARPA.

## **4.1 System Architecture and Data Flow**

ARPA's architecture implements an end-to-end pipeline from unstructured text to interactive Bayesian network visualization. The system comprises five primary components organized sequentially, each transforming data into progressively more structured and formal representations:

1. **Text Ingestion and Preprocessing**: Source documents (papers, blog posts, expert reports) enter the system through APIs or manual upload. These documents undergo preprocessing including format normalization, metadata extraction, and relevance filtering. The preprocessed documents are stored in a version-controlled repository with citation information preserved.

2. **BayesDown Extraction**: Documents are processed to identify and extract argument structures, causal relationships, and probabilistic judgments. This information is represented in BayesDown format—an extension of ArgDown that incorporates probability distributions and instantiations. While the current implementation focuses on processing pre-formatted BayesDown, the architecture includes placeholders for LLM-powered extraction directly from natural language.

3. **Structured Data Transformation**: BayesDown representations are parsed into structured data formats (primarily pandas DataFrames) containing all necessary information for constructing Bayesian networks. This includes node identifiers, descriptions, parent-child relationships, instantiations, prior probabilities, and conditional probability tables.

4. **Bayesian Network Construction**: Structured data is transformed into formal Bayesian networks with nodes representing variables and edges representing conditional dependencies. This includes both the mathematical representation of the network and the parameterization of conditional probability distributions.

5. **Interactive Visualization**: The Bayesian network is rendered as an interactive visualization allowing users to explore the model, understand probability distributions, and analyze causal relationships. This component emphasizes intuitive understanding, using visual cues to indicate probability magnitudes and node types.

The data flows through these components sequentially, with each transformation preserving the essential information while adding structure and formalism. Figure 4.1 illustrates this flow, showing how information progresses from unstructured text to interactive visualization.

\[Figure 4.1: Data flow through the ARPA system components\]

This architecture embodies several key design principles:

* **Modularity**: Components are designed with clear interfaces, allowing them to be developed, tested, and improved independently.  
* **Explicitness**: Each transformation is made explicit, preserving the connection between source text and final model to ensure traceability.  
* **Interactivity**: The system prioritizes human understanding and interaction, recognizing that the ultimate goal is to improve human decision-making rather than merely producing formal models.  
* **Extensibility**: The architecture accommodates future enhancements, with clear points for integrating more sophisticated extraction techniques, inference engines, prediction market connections, and policy evaluation tools.

While the current implementation focuses on the core pipeline from BayesDown to visualization, the architecture includes defined interfaces for the additional components needed to realize the complete ARPA vision: a probabilistic inference engine for reasoning under uncertainty, a prediction market integration module for incorporating live forecast data, and a policy evaluation interface for assessing intervention impacts.

## **4.2 Automated Extraction Pipeline**

The extraction pipeline transforms semi-structured arguments into formalized representations suitable for probabilistic modeling. At the heart of this pipeline is BayesDown—a novel intermediate representation that extends the ArgDown argument mapping notation with probabilistic information.

### **4.2.1 BayesDown: Bridging Natural Language and Bayesian Networks**

BayesDown serves as a crucial bridge between the qualitative reasoning prevalent in AI governance discourse and the quantitative formalism needed for rigorous analysis. It accomplishes this by combining the structural clarity of argument maps with the probabilistic precision of Bayesian networks.

Consider the following BayesDown example, representing a simple causal network involving rain, a sprinkler, and wet grass:

\[Grass\_Wet\]: Concentrated moisture on, between and around the blades of grass. {"instantiations": \["grass\_wet\_TRUE", "grass\_wet\_FALSE"\], "priors": {"p(grass\_wet\_TRUE)": "0.322","p(grass\_wet\_FALSE)": "0.678"},"posteriors": {"p(grass\_wet\_TRUE|sprinkler\_TRUE,rain\_TRUE)": "0.99","p(grass\_wet\_TRUE|sprinkler\_TRUE,rain\_FALSE)": "0.9","p(grass\_wet\_TRUE|sprinkler\_FALSE,rain\_TRUE)": "0.8","p(grass\_wet\_TRUE|sprinkler\_FALSE,rain\_FALSE)": "0.0","p(grass\_wet\_FALSE|sprinkler\_TRUE,rain\_TRUE)": "0.01","p(grass\_wet\_FALSE|sprinkler\_TRUE,rain\_FALSE)": "0.1","p(grass\_wet\_FALSE|sprinkler\_FALSE,rain\_TRUE)": "0.2","p(grass\_wet\_FALSE|sprinkler\_FALSE,rain\_FALSE)": "1.0"}}  
 \+ \[Rain\]: Tears of angles crying high up in the skies hitting the ground.{"instantiations": \["rain\_TRUE", "rain\_FALSE"\],"priors": {"p(rain\_TRUE)": "0.2","p(rain\_FALSE)": "0.8"},"posteriors": {}}  
 \+ \[Sprinkler\]: Activation of a centrifugal force based CO2 droplet distribution system.{"instantiations": \["sprinkler\_TRUE", "sprinkler\_FALSE"\],"priors": {"p(sprinkler\_TRUE)": "0.44838","p(sprinkler\_FALSE)": "0.55162"},"posteriors": {"p(sprinkler\_TRUE|rain\_TRUE)": "0.01","p(sprinkler\_TRUE|rain\_FALSE)": "0.4","p(sprinkler\_FALSE|rain\_TRUE)": "0.99","p(sprinkler\_FALSE|rain\_FALSE)":"0.6"}}  
  \+ \[Rain\]

This example demonstrates BayesDown's key features:

1. **Node Definitions**: Each node (e.g., `[Grass_Wet]`) includes a descriptive label and narrative explanation.  
2. **Relationship Markup**: Hierarchical relationships are indicated with `+` symbols and indentation.  
3. **Probabilistic Metadata**: Each node includes structured JSON metadata with:  
   * `instantiations`: Possible states of the variable  
   * `priors`: Unconditional probability distributions  
   * `posteriors`: Conditional probability tables defining relationships with parent nodes

BayesDown thus captures both the qualitative structure of arguments and the quantitative parameterization needed for probabilistic inference. This dual representation enables the extraction pipeline to maintain the connection between natural language justifications and formal model components.

### **4.2.2 Extraction Algorithm**

The current implementation focuses on parsing pre-formatted BayesDown into structured data. The extraction algorithm comprises several key steps:

1. **Preprocessing**: Comments and irrelevant markup are removed from the input text.  
2. **Structure Identification**: The algorithm identifies nodes, their descriptions, and hierarchical relationships through regex pattern matching and indentation analysis.  
3. **Relationship Mapping**: Parent-child relationships are established based on both explicit connections and hierarchical structure.  
4. **Metadata Extraction**: JSON metadata is parsed to extract instantiations, prior probabilities, and conditional probability tables.  
5. **Dataframe Construction**: All extracted information is organized into a structured DataFrame containing all necessary information for Bayesian network construction.

The core extraction function, `parse_markdown_hierarchy`, orchestrates this process:

def parse\_markdown\_hierarchy(markdown\_text):  
    """Main function to parse markdown hierarchy into a DataFrame"""  
    \# Remove comments  
    clean\_text \= remove\_comments(markdown\_text)  
    \# Extract all titles with their descriptions and indentation levels  
    titles\_info \= extract\_titles\_info(clean\_text)  
    \# Establish parent-child relationships  
    titles\_with\_relations \= establish\_relationships(titles\_info, clean\_text)  
    \# Convert to DataFrame  
    df \= convert\_to\_dataframe(titles\_with\_relations)  
    \# Add No\_Parent and No\_Children columns  
    df \= add\_no\_parent\_no\_child\_columns\_to\_df(df)  
    return df

Supporting functions handle specific aspects of extraction:

* `remove_comments`: Eliminates comment blocks that don't affect the formal structure  
* `extract_titles_info`: Identifies node titles, descriptions, and indentation levels  
* `establish_relationships`: Determines parent-child relationships based on structure  
* `convert_to_dataframe`: Organizes extracted information into a structured DataFrame  
* `add_no_parent_no_child_columns_to_df`: Adds auxiliary information for network analysis

The algorithm is designed to be robust to variations in formatting while preserving the essential information needed for model construction. The resulting DataFrame contains all necessary information for constructing a fully specified Bayesian network, including node identifications, hierarchical relationships, and probability distributions.

### **4.2.3 From Extraction to LLM Automation**

While the current implementation focuses on parsing pre-formatted BayesDown, the architecture includes placeholders for LLM-powered extraction directly from natural language. This future enhancement would use frontier language models to:

1. Identify key variables, claims, and causal relationships in natural language texts  
2. Map the identified elements into a hierarchical argument structure  
3. Extract explicit and implicit probability judgments  
4. Generate BayesDown representations automatically

The modular architecture allows this enhancement to be developed independently and integrated seamlessly once available. The current parser would then serve as the second stage in a more comprehensive extraction pipeline, maintaining compatibility with both manually created BayesDown and automatically generated representations.

## **4.3 Network Construction and Visualization**

Once information has been extracted and structured, ARPA constructs and visualizes the corresponding Bayesian network. This component transforms tabular data into an interactive network representation that makes complex causal relationships and probability distributions accessible to human interpretation.

### **4.3.1 Network Construction**

The network construction process creates a mathematical representation of the Bayesian network based on the structured data extracted from BayesDown. This involves:

1. **Node Creation**: Each row in the extracted DataFrame becomes a node in the network, with associated attributes including description, instantiations, and probability distributions.  
2. **Edge Definition**: Parent-child relationships identified during extraction become directed edges in the network, representing conditional dependencies.  
3. **Probability Assignment**: Prior and conditional probabilities from the extraction phase are assigned to the appropriate nodes and edges.  
4. **Network Classification**: Nodes are classified based on their position in the network structure (e.g., root nodes, leaf nodes, intermediate nodes), enabling specialized visual treatment.

The implementation uses NetworkX for the core graph representation, which provides a flexible foundation for both mathematical operations and visualization:

def create\_bayesian\_network\_with\_probabilities(df):  
    """Create an interactive Bayesian network visualization with enhanced probability visualization"""  
    \# Create a directed graph  
    G \= nx.DiGraph()  
      
    \# Add nodes with proper attributes  
    for idx, row in df.iterrows():  
        title \= row\['Title'\]  
        description \= row\['Description'\]  
          
        \# Process probability information  
        priors \= get\_priors(row)  
        instantiations \= get\_instantiations(row)  
          
        \# Add node with base information  
        G.add\_node(  
            title,  
            description=description,  
            priors=priors,  
            instantiations=instantiations,  
            posteriors=get\_posteriors(row)  
        )  
      
    \# Add edges  
    for idx, row in df.iterrows():  
        child \= row\['Title'\]  
        parents \= get\_parents(row)  
          
        \# Add edges from each parent to this child  
        for parent in parents:  
            if parent in G.nodes():  
                G.add\_edge(parent, child)  
      
    \# Classify nodes based on network structure  
    classify\_nodes(G)  
      
    \# \[Visualization code follows...\]

This construction process preserves all the information needed for both visual representation and probabilistic reasoning. The resulting network includes both structural information (nodes and edges) and parametric information (probability distributions), enabling comprehensive model analysis.

### **4.3.2 Interactive Visualization**

The visualization component transforms the mathematical network representation into an interactive visual form that emphasizes human understanding. This involves several key design principles:

1. **Intuitive Visual Encoding**: Node colors reflect probability values, with green indicating high probability of the primary state and red indicating low probability. Border colors indicate node types (root, intermediate, leaf).  
2. **Interactive Exploration**: Users can click nodes to see detailed probability information, drag nodes to explore different network arrangements, and adjust visualization parameters.  
3. **Probability Visualization**: Probability distributions are visualized through progress bars and color gradients, making numerical values more intuitive.  
4. **Contextual Information**: Tooltips provide summary information, while click interactions reveal comprehensive probability details including conditional distributions.

The implementation uses PyVis (built on vis.js) for network visualization, with extensive customization to represent probabilistic information effectively:

def create\_bayesian\_network\_with\_probabilities(df):  
    """Create an interactive Bayesian network visualization with enhanced probability visualization"""  
    \# Create a directed graph  
    G \= nx.DiGraph()  
      
    \# Add nodes with proper attributes  
    for idx, row in df.iterrows():  
        title \= row\['Title'\]  
        description \= row\['Description'\]  
          
        \# Process probability information  
        priors \= get\_priors(row)  
        instantiations \= get\_instantiations(row)  
          
        \# Add node with base information  
        G.add\_node(  
            title,  
            description=description,  
            priors=priors,  
            instantiations=instantiations,  
            posteriors=get\_posteriors(row)  
        )  
      
    \# Add edges  
    for idx, row in df.iterrows():  
        child \= row\['Title'\]  
        parents \= get\_parents(row)  
          
        \# Add edges from each parent to this child  
        for parent in parents:  
            if parent in G.nodes():  
                G.add\_edge(parent, child)  
      
    \# Classify nodes based on network structure  
    classify\_nodes(G)  
      
    \# \[Visualization code follows...\]

This visualization approach addresses a key limitation of traditional Bayesian network representations: their lack of accessibility to non-specialists. By using color, interactive elements, and intuitive visual representations of probability, ARPA makes complex probabilistic relationships accessible to a broader audience, including policymakers without technical backgrounds in Bayesian statistics.

### **4.3.3. Visualization Example: The Rain-Sprinkler-Grass\_Wet Network**

To illustrate the visualization capabilities, consider the classic Rain-Sprinkler-Grass\_Wet example used throughout this thesis. When processed through the ARPA pipeline, this simple causal network is rendered as an interactive visualization with the following features:

1. Three nodes representing the variables: Rain, Sprinkler, and Grass\_Wet  
2. Directed edges showing causal influences: Rain → Sprinkler, Rain → Grass\_Wet, and Sprinkler → Grass\_Wet  
3. Color-coded nodes showing probability distributions (e.g., Rain node shows 20% probability of rain with appropriate coloring)  
4. Border colors indicating node types (Rain as a root node, Sprinkler as an intermediate node, Grass\_Wet as a leaf node)

\[Figure 4.2: Visualization of the Rain-Sprinkler-Grass\_Wet Bayesian network\]

This simple example demonstrates the core visualization principles that scale to more complex networks representing AI risk pathways. The same visual encoding—color for probability, border for node type, directed edges for causality—applies equally well to networks with dozens or hundreds of variables, providing a consistent interface for understanding models of varying complexity.

The visualization component thus completes the core ARPA pipeline, transforming unstructured text through intermediate representations into an interactive, interpretable model. This foundation enables the additional analytical capabilities—probabilistic inference, prediction market integration, and policy evaluation—that will build upon the constructed networks in future work.
