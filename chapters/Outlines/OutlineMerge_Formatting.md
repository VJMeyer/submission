# Outline Merging and Re-Formatting

# PromptGeneration

First, comprehensive review of ALL files (as much of this in reasoning space / thinking tokens as possible but key insights printed as overview). 
From github repository, context window and prompt.
Explain each file, it's structure, contents and relation and relevance to the AMTAIR MA-Thesis etc..
Extra detailed analysis of outlines, syntax instructions (task handling/handling) and colab notebook(.md).


Second, plan how to merge the two outlines without removing ANY contents or information and simoultaneously updating EVERYTHING into the absolute best quarto syntax and formatting -- following the instructions to the letter.

Plan how to find the most optimal way to combine the structures of the two outlines and merge their all their contents into one.
The resulting outline should be almost the length of both outlines combined but while maintaining the same structure of chapters / level 1 headings.


Ensure closest possible adherence to quarto formatting instructions / best practice -- overdo it:


Full implementation of quarto syntax task management system as described in instructions:


Full implementation and strictest adherence to quarto syntax tagging and highlighting system as described in instructions:

Verify complete adherence to all points of the checklists:


Give yourself the the most detailed and rigerous, written instructions for which formatting to use when, why and how.


Lastly, produce the perfect, combined outline.










# Prompt1



You are the most brilliant an AI assistant with maximum thinking tokens.
You are tasked with analyzing and merging content for an AMTAIR MA-Thesis project.
Follow these instructions carefully to complete the task:

1. Review and analyze the contents of the GitHub repository, context window, and this prompt:
<github_repo_contents>
{{GITHUB_REPO_CONTENTS}}
</github_repo_contents>

<project_context_window>
{{PROJECT_CONTEXT_WINDOW}}
</project_context_window>

Provide a comprehensive overview of all files, explaining their structure, contents, and relevance to the AMTAIR MA-Thesis (do as much of this in reasoning space / thinking tokens as possible but key insights printed as overview).
Focus on key insights and relationships between files.
Present this overview in <file_analysis> tags.

2. Conduct an extra detailed analysis of the outlines, syntax instructions, and Colab notebook:
<outline1>
{{OUTLINE_12.2.qmd.md}}
</outline1>

<outline2>
{{OUTLINE_11.7.qmd.md}}
</outline2>

<syntax_instructions>
{{QUARTO_SYNTAX_INSTRUCTIONS}}
</syntax_instructions>

<colab_notebook>
{{COLAB_NOTEBOOK}}
</colab_notebook>

Present this detailed analysis in <detailed_analysis> tags.

3. Plan the merging of the two outlines:
a) Develop a strategy to combine all contents without removing ANY information.
b) Find the optimal way to merge the structures while maintaining the same number of chapters/level 1 headings.
c) Ensure the resulting outline is close to the combined length of both original outlines combined.
d) Add contents and improvements throughout as you notice them

Present your merging plan in <merging_plan> tags.

4. Implement perfect Quarto syntax and formatting, task management and tracking and tagging and highlighting:


<quarto_instructions>
{{QUARTO_SYNTAX_INSTRUCTIONS}}
</quarto_instructions>



a) Fully implement the Quarto syntax task management system as described in the instructions.
b) Implement and strictly adhere to the Quarto syntax tagging and highlighting system.
c) Provide detailed instructions for which formatting to use when, why, and how.

Write the the most detailed and rigerous, written instructions for which formatting to use when, why and how.

Present your Quarto implementation plan in <quarto_implementation> tags.

5. Ensure adherence to all points in the checklists:

<checklists>
{{CHECKLISTS_IN_QUARTO_SYNTAX_INSTRUCTIONS}}
</checklists>

Verify and confirm complete adherence to all checklist items in <checklist_adherence> tags.

6. Produce the final, combined outline:
Based on all the previous steps, create the perfect, combined outline that incorporates all content from both original outlines, adheres to Quarto formatting, and follows all instructions and best practices.
Present this final outline in <final_outline> tags.

Your final output has to include all of the following sections, in this order:
<file_analysis>
<detailed_analysis>
<merging_plan>
<quarto_implementation>
<checklist_adherence>
<final_outline>

Ensure that each section is comprehensive and addresses all aspects of the task as described in these instructions.
