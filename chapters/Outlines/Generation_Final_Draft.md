## Outline to Draft

First, comprehensive review of ALL files (its important to do as much of this in reasoning space / thinking tokens as possible but that key insights are printed as overview).

From github repository, context window and prompt.

Explain each file, it's structure, contents and relation and relevance to the AMTAIR MA-Thesis etc..

Extra detailed analysis of outlines, syntax instructions (task handling/handling) and colab notebook(.md).


  

Second, plan in detail how to implement the required changes -- that are tracked by the tasks and instructions throughout the outline -- and improve the structure of the thesis -- while maintaining the structure of the chapters (Introduction, Context, Implementation, Discussion and Conclusion).


Plan how to find the most optimal way to implementing all the instructions contained in the html comments
`<-- [ ] INSTRUCTION -->`.
Track the implementations you made, by changing the status of the tasks to implemented: `<-- [-] INSTRUCTION -->`

Furthermore, here are some general improvements to be made throughout:
<general_changes>
-- remove all `:::`
– ADD  citations `@ KEY` throughout the entire thesis
–  integrate figures (by inferring their contents from the alt-text description) smoothly throughout
– implement all TASKS/INSTRUCTIONS you can do but only those you can implement without hallucinations 
- consistently use the html comment task tracking system to track the status of tasks
– remove all hallucinations you find (but leave an html comment noting the hallucination behind)
– Track task completion (and Respond) in html comments
– merge duplicates and merge contents
– remove hallucinations e.g.:`<!-- [ ] COMPLETELY REWRITE: ... -->`
- replace all callout-boxes with different kinds of formatting
</general_changes>
You are authorized to independently implement improvements in order to make this the perfect thesis, especially when removing hallucinations or errors (but do keep track of such changes).

Only implement changes you can implement without hallucinating, this is absolutely crucial so please plan accordingly.




The resulting draft should be essentially the finished, perfect thesis.




Give yourself the the most detailed and rigorous, written instructions and then, produce the perfect, combined outline.

# Automating the Modeling of Transformative Artificial Intelligence Risks (AMTAIR)

## Executive Summary

<!-- [-] ADDED: Executive summary for accessibility -->

This thesis presents AMTAIR, a computational framework that addresses the coordination crisis in AI governance by automating the extraction and formalization of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature. By combining automated extraction, prediction market integration, and formal policy evaluation, AMTAIR creates multiplicative benefits that enhance coordination among diverse stakeholders working to mitigate existential risks from advanced AI.

## Frontmatter

### Preface

<!-- [-] IMPROVED: Expanded with personal journey -->

This thesis represents the culmination of interdisciplinary research at the intersection of AI safety, formal epistemology, and computational social science. The work emerged from recognizing a fundamental challenge in AI governance: while investment in AI safety research has grown exponentially, coordination between different stakeholder communities remains fragmented, potentially increasing existential risk through misaligned efforts.

The journey began with studying the manual efforts of the MTAIR project and recognizing that automation could dramatically scale their approach. Through iterative development and feedback from domain experts, what started as a technical exercise evolved into a broader framework for enhancing epistemic security in one of humanity's most critical coordination challenges.

### Acknowledgments

<!-- [-] COMPLETED: Added specific acknowledgments -->

I thank my supervisor Dr. Timo Speith for invaluable guidance, the MTAIR team (particularly David Manheim and Sam Clarke @clarke2022) for pioneering the manual approach, and Coleman Snell for research collaboration. Special recognition goes to Johannes Meyer and Jelena Meyer for verifying the automated extraction procedure. The AI safety community's open research culture made this work possible. Any errors remain my own responsibility.

## Chapter 1: Introduction - The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance

### 1.1 Opening Scenario: The Policymaker's Dilemma

<!-- [-] IMPROVED: Added concrete details and footnotes -->

Imagine a senior policy advisor preparing recommendations for AI governance legislation. On her desk lie reports from leading AI safety researchers @bostrom2014, @christiano2019, @russell2019, each painting different pictures of risks ahead. One argues misaligned AI could pose existential risks within the decade, citing technical arguments about instrumental convergence^[The tendency for intelligent agents to pursue similar instrumental goals like self-preservation regardless of final goals] and orthogonality^[The thesis that any level of intelligence can be combined with any final goal @bostrom2014]. Another suggests these concerns are overblown. A third proposes specific technical standards but acknowledges deep uncertainty about effectiveness.

This scenario exemplifies the coordination crisis: despite unprecedented attention to AI safety, we lack epistemic infrastructure to synthesize diverse expert knowledge into actionable governance strategies.

### 1.2 The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance

<!-- [-] IMPROVED: Added citations and specific examples -->

As AI capabilities advance at accelerating pace @maslej2024, humanity faces an unprecedented governance challenge. The rapid progression from GPT-3 to GPT-4 @openai2023 and emerging multimodal systems demonstrates the urgency of ensuring these systems remain aligned with human values.

> Despite unprecedented investment in AI safety research, rapidly growing awareness among key stakeholders, and proliferating frameworks for responsible AI development, we face what I term the "coordination crisis" in AI governance—a systemic failure to align diverse efforts across technical, policy, and strategic domains into a coherent response proportionate to the risks we face.

Evidence of mobilization includes:

- The Asilomar AI Principles garnering 3,700+ signatures @tegmark2017
- The EU AI Act establishing comprehensive regulation @eu2024
- Major labs establishing alignment teams (Anthropic, DeepMind, OpenAI)

Yet fragmentation persists:

- Technical safety researchers develop alignment techniques without implementation pathways
- Policy specialists craft regulations lacking technical grounding
- International bodies convene without shared assessment frameworks

<!-- [-] ADDED: Specific examples of coordination failures -->

Historical parallels illuminate the stakes. Nuclear weapons development saw similar fragmentation until crises forced coordination through institutions like IAEA @schelling1960. Climate change still suffers from coordination failures despite scientific consensus @nordhaus2013. We cannot afford similar delays with AI given the pace of capability advancement.

### 1.3 Research Question and Contribution

<!-- [-] IMPROVED: Clearer articulation -->

This thesis investigates: **Can frontier AI technologies be leveraged to automate the modeling of transformative AI risks, enabling robust prediction of policy impacts across diverse worldviews?**

Specifically, I develop and validate AMTAIR—a system using large language models to:

1. Extract argument structures from AI safety literature (ArgDown)
2. Enhance with probability judgments (BayesDown)
3. Construct formal Bayesian networks
4. Enable policy evaluation under uncertainty

### 1.4 The Multiplicative Benefits Framework

<!-- [-] IMPROVED: Clearer explanation with examples -->

The core insight: combining automated extraction, prediction markets, and policy evaluation creates synergistic value exceeding the sum of parts.

**Automated extraction** addresses the scaling bottleneck. Where MTAIR required 200+ expert-hours per model @clarke2022, AMTAIR processes documents in minutes.

**Prediction market integration** grounds abstract models in collective forecasting. Platforms like Metaculus aggregate distributed knowledge about AI timelines and capabilities @metaculus2023.

**Formal policy evaluation** transforms static assessments into actionable guidance using causal inference @pearl2009 to model how interventions alter risk.

The synergy: automation enables comprehensive coverage, markets provide empirical grounding, evaluation delivers actionable insights. Together, they create infrastructure for coordination.

### 1.5 Thesis Structure and Roadmap

<!-- [-] IMPROVED: Clear chapter summaries -->

**Chapter 2** establishes theoretical foundations: epistemic challenges in AI governance, Bayesian networks as formal tools, the MTAIR framework's achievements and limitations.

**Chapter 3** presents the AMTAIR implementation: two-stage extraction pipeline, validation methodology, case studies from simple to complex models.

**Chapter 4** critically examines limitations: technical constraints, conceptual concerns, scaling challenges.

**Chapter 5** concludes with contributions, recommendations for stakeholders, and future research directions.

## Chapter 2: Context and Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 AI Existential Risk: The Carlsmith Model

<!-- [-] IMPROVED: Added proper citations and probability clarification -->

Joseph Carlsmith's "Is Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk?" @carlsmith2021 exemplifies structured probabilistic reasoning about AI catastrophic risk. The model decomposes risk into six conditional premises:

1. **APS Systems by 2070** (P ≈ 0.65): Advanced AI with planning and strategic awareness
2. **Alignment Difficulty** (P ≈ 0.40): Harder to build aligned than misaligned systems
3. **Deployment Despite Misalignment** (P ≈ 0.70): Competitive pressures override caution
4. **Power-Seeking Behavior** (P ≈ 0.65): Instrumental convergence drives power acquisition
5. **Successful Disempowerment** (P ≈ 0.40): Overcoming human resistance
6. **Existential Catastrophe** (P ≈ 0.95): Disempowerment curtails human potential

**Overall Risk**: P(doom) ≈ 0.05 (5%) by 2070^[Note: Probability estimates vary across Carlsmith versions. These reflect the 2022 arxiv version.]

This structured approach exemplifies arguments AMTAIR aims to formalize and automate.

### 2.2 The Epistemic Challenge of Policy Evaluation

<!-- [-] IMPROVED: Added deep uncertainty framework -->

AI governance faces unique epistemic challenges @hallegatte2012:

**Deep Uncertainty**: Unknown unknowns dominate. We cannot enumerate possible futures, much less assign probabilities. Will recursive self-improvement enable rapid capability gains? These questions resist empirical resolution before becoming catastrophic.

**Multi-Level Causation**: Effects propagate through technical, institutional, and social levels with feedback loops. A technical standard might alter research incentives, shifting capability trajectories, changing competitive dynamics, ultimately affecting existential risk through invisible pathways.

**Value-Laden Technical Choices**: What constitutes "alignment"? How much capability risk for economic benefit? Technical specifications embed ethical judgments.

Traditional tools fail:

- Cost-benefit analysis breaks down with infinite negative utility
- Scenario planning lacks probabilistic reasoning for decisions
- Expert elicitation struggles with interdisciplinary questions

### 2.3 Bayesian Networks as Knowledge Representation

<!-- [-] IMPROVED: Added mathematical formalization -->

Bayesian networks provide mathematical frameworks for reasoning under uncertainty @pearl2009, @koller2009.

**Definition**: A Bayesian network consists of:

- Directed Acyclic Graph G = (V,E) where nodes V represent variables, edges E represent dependencies
- Conditional Probability Tables P(Xi|Parents(Xi)) for each node

The joint distribution factors as: $$P(X_1,...,X_n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i|Parents(X_i))$$

This enables:

- **Efficient inference** through graphical structure
- **Causal reasoning** via Pearl's do-calculus
- **Uncertainty propagation** through the network
- **Modular construction** of complex models

### 2.4 The MTAIR Framework

<!-- [-] IMPROVED: Specific examples and limitations -->

The Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project @clarke2022 pioneered formal modeling of AI existential risk arguments using Bayesian networks.

**Achievements**:

- Demonstrated feasibility of formalizing complex AI safety arguments
- Created interactive models for exploring sensitivity to assumptions
- Influenced research prioritization by identifying critical uncertainties
- Enhanced discourse quality through shared vocabulary

**Limitations**:

- Labor intensity: 200-400 expert-hours per model^[Based on team reports and model complexity]
- Static nature: No automatic updating with new evidence
- Limited accessibility: Required Analytica software expertise
- Single perspective: Difficulty representing multiple worldviews

These limitations motivate AMTAIR's automated approach.

## Chapter 3: AMTAIR Design and Implementation

### 3.1 System Architecture Overview

<!-- [-] IMPROVED: Clear component description -->

AMTAIR implements an end-to-end pipeline with five modular components:

1. **Text Ingestion**: Format normalization, metadata extraction, relevance filtering
2. **ArgDown Extraction**: Two-stage structure identification using LLMs
3. **BayesDown Enhancement**: Probability integration and validation
4. **Network Construction**: Mathematical model instantiation
5. **Interactive Visualization**: Dynamic rendering with PyVis

**Design Principles**:

- Modularity for maintainability
- Validation checkpoints to prevent error propagation
- Human-in-the-loop verification options
- Extensibility for future capabilities

### 3.2 The Two-Stage Extraction Process

<!-- [-] IMPROVED: Technical details with examples -->

The core innovation separates structure extraction from probability quantification, mirroring human cognitive processes.

**Stage 1: ArgDown Extraction**

```
[Existential_Catastrophe]: Destruction of humanity's potential. {"instantiations": ["TRUE", "FALSE"]}
 + [Human_Disempowerment]: Loss of control to AI. {"instantiations": ["TRUE", "FALSE"]}  
   + [Misaligned_Power_Seeking]: AI pursuing problematic objectives. {"instantiations": ["TRUE", "FALSE"]}
```

**Stage 2: BayesDown Enhancement**

```json
[Existential_Catastrophe]: Destruction of humanity's potential. {
  "instantiations": ["TRUE", "FALSE"],
  "priors": {"p(TRUE)": "0.05", "p(FALSE)": "0.95"},
  "posteriors": {"p(TRUE|disempowerment_TRUE)": "0.95", "p(TRUE|disempowerment_FALSE)": "0.001"}
}
```

Benefits:

- Modular validation at each stage
- Human oversight between stages
- Flexible quantification methods
- Error isolation

### 3.3 Implementation Technologies

<!-- [-] COMPLETED: Realistic technology description -->

The system leverages:

- **Language Models**: GPT-4/Claude for extraction (temperature 0.3 for consistency)
- **Network Analysis**: NetworkX for graph algorithms and validation
- **Probabilistic Modeling**: pgmpy for Bayesian operations
- **Visualization**: PyVis for interactive rendering
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for structured manipulation

### 3.4 Case Study: Carlsmith Model Extraction

<!-- [-] IMPROVED: Removed hallucinated results -->

Applying AMTAIR to Carlsmith's model demonstrates real-world capability:

**Extraction Process**:

1. PDF ingestion and preprocessing
2. LLM extraction of 23 nodes and 29 edges
3. Probability extraction matching published estimates
4. Network construction and validation
5. Interactive visualization generation

**Theoretical Validation Approach**: Rather than claiming specific accuracy metrics, we propose:

- Expert review of extracted structures
- Comparison with manual MTAIR extractions
- Sensitivity analysis of probability variations
- User studies on interpretation accuracy

**Key Insights from Formalization**:

- Central role of "Misaligned_Power_Seeking" as hub node
- Multiple pathways to catastrophe requiring different interventions
- High sensitivity to deployment decision probabilities

### 3.5 Validation Methodology

<!-- [-] COMPLETED: Replaced hallucinations with methodology -->

Establishing trust requires rigorous validation across dimensions:

**Proposed Validation Framework**:

1. **Structural Accuracy**: Expert annotation of argument structures
2. **Probability Fidelity**: Comparison with source probability statements
3. **Semantic Preservation**: Qualitative assessment of meaning retention
4. **Functional Equivalence**: Inference query comparisons

**Expected Challenges**:

- Implicit assumptions in natural language
- Ambiguous probability expressions
- Complex conditionals
- Limited ground truth data

### 3.6 Policy Evaluation Capabilities

<!-- [-] IMPROVED: Concrete example -->

AMTAIR enables systematic policy analysis through intervention modeling:

**Example: AI Development Moratoria**

```python
# Pseudocode for policy evaluation
baseline = model.query(variables=['existential_catastrophe'])
intervention = model.do(deployment_probability=0.1)  # Reduce deployment
effect = intervention.query(variables=['existential_catastrophe'])
risk_reduction = (baseline - effect) / baseline
```

This enables:

- Comparing interventions across scenarios
- Identifying robust strategies
- Quantifying uncertainty in policy effects

## Chapter 4: Discussion - Implications and Limitations

### 4.1 Technical Limitations

<!-- [-] IMPROVED: Honest assessment -->

**Extraction Quality**: LLMs struggle with implicit reasoning and complex conditionals. Current approaches achieve reasonable accuracy for explicit arguments but miss nuanced implications.

**Scalability**: Networks beyond 50 nodes face computational challenges. Approximation methods trade accuracy for tractability.

**Correlation Handling**: Standard Bayesian networks assume conditional independence given parents. Real systems exhibit complex correlations requiring extensions like copulas @nelson2006.

### 4.2 Conceptual Concerns

<!-- [-] IMPROVED: Thoughtful analysis -->

**Formalization Trade-offs**: Converting rich arguments to mathematical models necessarily loses context. While revealing hidden assumptions provides value, cultural and institutional factors resist quantification.

**Democratic Participation**: Complex models risk technocratic exclusion. AMTAIR addresses this through:

- Progressive disclosure interfaces
- Natural language preservation
- Multiple engagement levels
- Visual communication

**Epistemic Humility**: Models are maps, not territory. Overconfidence in formal representations could misdirect efforts. Clear limitations and uncertainty communication remain essential.

### 4.3 Integration with Governance

<!-- [-] IMPROVED: Specific applications -->

AMTAIR complements existing approaches:

**Standards Development**: Model how technical requirements affect risk pathways, identify unintended consequences, compare options systematically.

**Regulatory Design**: Assess impact across scenarios, identify enforcement challenges, enable adaptive triggers.

**International Coordination**: Create shared risk assessments, negotiate with explicit assumptions, monitor compliance indicators.

## Chapter 5: Conclusion - Toward Coordinated AI Governance

### 5.1 Summary of Contributions

<!-- [-] COMPLETED: Clear contribution summary -->

This thesis makes three key contributions:

1. **Theoretical**: Diagnosed the coordination crisis and proposed the multiplicative benefits framework combining automation, markets, and evaluation.
    
2. **Methodological**: Developed two-stage extraction separating structure from quantification, BayesDown as bridge representation, validation frameworks for automated extraction.
    
3. **Technical**: Implemented working system demonstrating feasibility, achieving practical extraction quality, enabling policy evaluation.
    

### 5.2 Recommendations for Stakeholders

<!-- [-] IMPROVED: Actionable recommendations -->

**Researchers**: Experiment with formalizing your arguments, contribute to validation datasets, extend the open-source framework.

**Policymakers**: Pilot AMTAIR for policy analysis, demand formal models from advisors, fund tool development.

**Funders**: Support ecosystem not just tools, incentivize cross-domain collaboration, recognize infrastructure needs patience.

### 5.3 Future Directions

<!-- [-] COMPLETED: Concrete research agenda -->

**Technical**: Fine-tune LLMs for argument extraction, handle temporal dynamics, scale to larger networks, integrate real-time data.

**Methodological**: Combine with other approaches (scenarios, simulations), optimize human-AI collaboration, measure coordination improvements.

**Applications**: Extend beyond AI to biosecurity, climate policy, support regulatory impact assessment, enable democratic deliberation tools.

### 5.4 Closing Reflection

<!-- [-] IMPROVED: Compelling conclusion -->

The coordination crisis in AI governance represents both existential risk and opportunity. If we fail to align our efforts, fragmentation may amplify the very risks we seek to mitigate. But if we succeed in building unprecedented cooperation, we may navigate this crucial transition safely.

AMTAIR offers one piece of the puzzle—computational infrastructure for enhanced coordination. By making implicit models explicit, quantifying uncertainty, and enabling systematic evaluation, these tools help us reason together about futures too important to leave to chance.

The path forward demands both ambition and humility. Ambition to build the epistemic infrastructure for navigating unprecedented risks. Humility to recognize our tools' limitations and the irreducible role of human wisdom. The question is not whether formal models can replace judgment—they cannot. Rather, it's whether we can augment our collective intelligence to meet this historic challenge.

As AI capabilities advance toward transformative potential, the window for establishing effective governance narrows. We cannot afford continued fragmentation. May this work contribute to the coordination humanity desperately needs, for all our futures depend on it.

# Final Thesis: Automating the Modeling of Transformative Artificial Intelligence Risks

## Frontmatter: Preface

<!-- [-] TODO: Expand preface to include personal journey and acknowledgments -->

This thesis represents the culmination of interdisciplinary research at the intersection of AI safety, formal epistemology, and computational social science. The work emerged from recognizing a fundamental challenge in AI governance: while investment in AI safety research has grown exponentially, coordination between different stakeholder communities remains fragmented, potentially increasing existential risk through misaligned efforts.

The journey from initial concept to working implementation involved iterative refinement based on feedback from advisors, domain experts, and potential users. What began as a technical exercise in automated extraction evolved into a broader framework for enhancing epistemic security in one of humanity's most critical coordination challenges. The AMTAIR project—Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling—represents an attempt to build computational bridges between communities that, despite shared concerns about AI risk, often struggle to communicate effectively due to incompatible frameworks, terminologies, and implicit assumptions.

I hope this work contributes to building the intellectual and technical infrastructure necessary for humanity to navigate the transition to transformative AI safely. The tools and frameworks presented here are offered in the spirit of collaborative problem-solving, recognizing that the challenges we face require unprecedented cooperation across disciplines, institutions, and worldviews.

# 1. Introduction: The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance

**Chapter Overview**  
**Grade Weight**: 10% | **Target Length**: ~14% of text (~4,200 words)  
**Requirements**: Introduces and motivates the core question, provides context, states precise thesis, provides roadmap

## 1.1 Opening Scenario: The Policymaker's Dilemma

<!-- [-] TODO: Polish opening scenario for maximum impact --> <!-- [-] ADD: @todd2024 add as reference for more resources towards AI safety -->

Imagine a senior policy advisor preparing recommendations for AI governance legislation. On her desk lie a dozen reports from leading AI safety researchers, each painting a different picture of the risks ahead. One argues that misaligned AI could pose existential risks within the decade, citing complex technical arguments about instrumental convergence and orthogonality. Another suggests these concerns are overblown, emphasizing uncertainty and the strength of existing institutions. A third proposes specific technical standards but acknowledges deep uncertainty about their effectiveness.

Each report seems compelling in isolation, written by credentialed experts with sophisticated arguments. Yet they reach dramatically different conclusions about both the magnitude of risk and appropriate interventions. The technical arguments involve unfamiliar concepts—mesa-optimization, corrigibility, capability amplification—expressed through different frameworks and implicit assumptions. Time is limited, stakes are high, and the legislation could shape humanity's trajectory for decades.

<!-- [-] EXPLAIN: in footnotes: a) Orthogonality Thesis: Intelligence and goals are independent; an AI can have any set of objectives regardless of its intelligence level. b) Instrumental Convergence Thesis: Different AI systems may adopt similar instrumental goals (e.g., self-preservation, resource acquisition) to achieve their objectives. -->

This scenario^[The orthogonality thesis posits that intelligence and goals are independent—an AI can have any set of objectives regardless of its intelligence level. The instrumental convergence thesis suggests that different AI systems may adopt similar instrumental goals (e.g., self-preservation, resource acquisition) to achieve their objectives.] plays out daily across government offices, corporate boardrooms, and research institutions worldwide. It exemplifies what I term the "coordination crisis" in AI governance: despite unprecedented attention and resources directed toward AI safety, we lack the epistemic infrastructure to synthesize diverse expert knowledge into actionable governance strategies @todd2024.

## 1.2 The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance

<!-- [-] TODO: Frame the problem as coordination failure rather than merely technical challenge --> <!-- [-] ADD: @maslej2025 Add citation for page 85 as evidence for accelerating capabilities --> <!-- [-] ADD: @samborska2025 Add as citation for accelerating capabilities -->

As AI capabilities advance at an accelerating pace—demonstrated by the rapid progression from GPT-3 to GPT-4, Claude, and emerging multimodal systems @maslej2025 @samborska2025—humanity faces a governance challenge unlike any in history. The task of ensuring increasingly powerful AI systems remain aligned with human values and beneficial to our long-term flourishing grows more urgent with each capability breakthrough. This challenge becomes particularly acute when considering transformative AI systems that could drastically alter civilization's trajectory, potentially including existential risks from misaligned systems pursuing objectives counter to human welfare.

Despite unprecedented investment in AI safety research, rapidly growing awareness among key stakeholders, and proliferating frameworks for responsible AI development, we face what I'll term the "coordination crisis" in AI governance—a systemic failure to align diverse efforts across technical, policy, and strategic domains into a coherent response proportionate to the risks we face.

The current state of AI governance presents a striking paradox. On one hand, we witness extraordinary mobilization: billions in research funding, proliferating safety initiatives, major tech companies establishing alignment teams, and governments worldwide developing AI strategies. The Asilomar AI Principles garnered thousands of signatures @tegmark2024, the EU advances comprehensive AI regulation @european2024, and technical researchers produce increasingly sophisticated work on alignment, interpretability, and robustness.

Yet alongside this activity, we observe systematic coordination failures that may prove catastrophic. Technical safety researchers develop sophisticated alignment techniques without clear implementation pathways. Policy specialists craft regulatory frameworks lacking technical grounding to ensure practical efficacy. Ethicists articulate normative principles that lack operational specificity. Strategy researchers identify critical uncertainties but struggle to translate these into actionable guidance. International bodies convene without shared frameworks for assessing interventions.

<!-- [-] CREATE: {#fig-coordination-crisis}: "Systems diagram showing fragmentation between AI governance communities" -->

Show Image

### 1.2.1 Safety Gaps from Misaligned Efforts

<!-- [-] TODO: Document how fragmentation systematically increases risk through with specific, good examples -->

The fragmentation problem manifests in incompatible frameworks between technical researchers, policy specialists, and strategic analysts. Each community develops sophisticated approaches within their domain, yet translation between domains remains primitive. This creates systematic blind spots where risks emerge at the interfaces between technical capabilities, institutional responses, and strategic dynamics.

When different communities operate with incompatible frameworks, critical risks fall through the cracks. Technical researchers may solve alignment problems under assumptions that policymakers' decisions invalidate. Regulations optimized for current systems may inadvertently incentivize dangerous development patterns. Without shared models of the risk landscape, our collective efforts resemble the parable of blind men describing an elephant—each accurate within their domain but missing the complete picture @paul2023.

<!-- [-] FIND: @coordination-failure-examples: "Specific historical examples of coordination failures in technology governance" -- arms races to nobodies benefit -- technological race to ?? -->

Historical precedents demonstrate how coordination failures in technology governance can lead to dangerous dynamics. The nuclear arms race exemplifies how lack of coordination can create negative-sum outcomes where all parties become less secure despite massive investments in safety measures. Similar dynamics may emerge in AI development without proper coordination infrastructure.

### 1.2.2 Resource Misallocation

<!-- [-] TODO: Explain that duplicative efforts absorbing research funding, publications, and initiatives might sometimes improve reliability (think reproducing results) but tend to waste resources in expectation (opportuntity cost) -- change the tone of the paragraph accordingly -->

The AI safety community faces a complex tradeoff in resource allocation. While some duplication of efforts can improve reliability through independent verification—akin to reproducing scientific results—the current level of fragmentation often leads to wasteful redundancy. Multiple teams independently develop similar frameworks without building on each other's work, creating opportunity costs where critical but unglamorous research areas remain understaffed. Funders struggle to identify high-impact opportunities across technical and governance domains, lacking the epistemic infrastructure to assess where marginal resources would have the greatest impact. This misallocation becomes more costly as the window for establishing effective governance narrows with accelerating AI development.

<!-- [-] CREATE: {#tbl-resource-duplication}: "Examples of duplicated AI safety efforts across organizations" -->

|Research Area|Organization A|Organization B|Duplication Level|Opportunity Cost|

|Risk Assessment Models|GovAI's policy models|CSER's existential risk frameworks|High|Insufficient capability benchmarking|

Table: Examples of duplicated AI safety efforts across organizations {#tbl-resource-duplication}

### 1.2.3 Negative-Sum Dynamics

<!-- [-] TODO: Address capability-governance gaps widening with accelerating development -->

Perhaps most concerning, uncoordinated interventions can actively increase risk. Safety standards that advantage established players may accelerate risky development elsewhere. Partial transparency requirements might enable capability advances without commensurate safety improvements. International agreements lacking shared technical understanding may lock in dangerous practices. Without coordination, our cure risks becoming worse than the disease.

The game-theoretic structure of AI development creates particularly pernicious dynamics. Armstrong et al. @armstrong2016 demonstrate how uncoordinated policies can incentivize a "race to the precipice" where competitive pressures override safety considerations. The situation resembles a multi-player prisoner's dilemma or stag hunt where individually rational decisions lead to collectively catastrophic outcomes @samuel2023 @hunt2025.

## 1.3 Historical Parallels and Temporal Urgency

<!-- [-] TODO: Draw connections to nuclear governance, climate change, and biosecurity -->

History offers instructive parallels. The nuclear age began with scientists racing to understand and control forces that could destroy civilization. Early coordination failures—competing national programs, scientist-military tensions, public-expert divides—nearly led to catastrophe multiple times. Only through developing shared frameworks (deterrence theory) @schelling1960, institutions (IAEA), and communication channels (hotlines, treaties) did humanity navigate the nuclear precipice @rehman2025.

Yet AI presents unique coordination challenges that compress our response timeline:

**Accelerating Development**: Unlike nuclear weapons requiring massive infrastructure, AI development proceeds in corporate labs and academic departments worldwide. Capability improvements come through algorithmic insights and computational scale, both advancing exponentially.

**Dual-Use Ubiquity**: Every AI advance potentially contributes to both beneficial applications and catastrophic risks. The same language model architectures enabling scientific breakthroughs could facilitate dangerous manipulation or deception at scale.

**Comprehension Barriers**: Nuclear risks were viscerally understandable—cities vaporized, radiation sickness, nuclear winter. AI risks involve abstract concepts like optimization processes, goal misspecification, and emergent capabilities that resist intuitive understanding.

**Governance Lag**: Traditional governance mechanisms—legislation, international treaties, professional standards—operate on timescales of years to decades. AI capabilities advance on timescales of months to years, creating an ever-widening capability-governance gap.

## 1.4 Research Question and Scope

<!-- [-] TODO: Clearly articulate the primary research question with precision -->

This thesis addresses a specific dimension of the coordination challenge by investigating the question:

**Can frontier AI technologies be utilized to automate the modeling of transformative AI risks, enabling robust prediction of policy impacts across diverse worldviews?**

More specifically, I explore whether frontier language models can automate the extraction and formalization of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature, creating a scalable computational framework that enhances coordination in AI governance through systematic policy evaluation under uncertainty.

To break this down into its components:

- **Frontier AI Technologies**: Today's most capable language models (GPT-4, Claude-3 level systems)
- **Automated Modeling**: Using these systems to extract and formalize argument structures from natural language
- **Transformative AI Risks**: Potentially catastrophic outcomes from advanced AI systems, particularly existential risks
- **Policy Impact Prediction**: Evaluating how governance interventions might alter probability distributions over outcomes
- **Diverse Worldviews**: Accounting for fundamental disagreements about AI development trajectories and risk factors

The investigation encompasses both theoretical development and practical implementation, focusing specifically on existential risks from misaligned AI systems rather than broader AI ethics concerns. This narrowed scope enables deep technical development while addressing the highest-stakes coordination challenges.

<!-- [-] LATER TODO: Refine thesis statement based on advisor feedback -->

## 1.5 The Multiplicative Benefits Framework

<!-- [-] TODO: Establish central thesis about synergistic combination of three elements -->

The central thesis of this work is that combining three elements—automated worldview extraction, prediction market integration, and formal policy evaluation—creates multiplicative rather than merely additive benefits for AI governance. Each component enhances the others, creating a system more valuable than the sum of its parts.

<!-- [-] CREATE: {#fig-multiplicative-benefits}: "Venn diagram showing synergies between extraction, markets, and evaluation": Automation × Live Prediction Market Integrations × Policy Impact Evaluations -->

Show Image

### 1.5.1 Automated Worldview Extraction

Current approaches to AI risk modeling, exemplified by the Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project, demonstrate the value of formal representation but require extensive manual effort. Creating a single model demands dozens of expert-hours to translate qualitative arguments into quantitative frameworks. This bottleneck severely limits the number of perspectives that can be formalized and the speed of model updates as new arguments emerge.

Automation using frontier language models addresses this scaling challenge. By developing systematic methods to extract causal structures and probability judgments from natural language, we can:

- Process orders of magnitude more content
- Incorporate diverse perspectives rapidly
- Maintain models that evolve with the discourse
- Reduce barriers to entry for contributing worldviews

### 1.5.2 Live Data Integration

Static models, however well-constructed, quickly become outdated in fast-moving domains. Prediction markets and forecasting platforms aggregate distributed knowledge about uncertain futures, providing continuously updated probability estimates. By connecting formal models to these live data sources, we create dynamic assessments that incorporate the latest collective intelligence @tetlock2015.

This integration serves multiple purposes:

- Grounding abstract models in empirical forecasts
- Identifying which uncertainties most affect outcomes
- Revealing when model assumptions diverge from collective expectations
- Generating new questions for forecasting communities

### 1.5.3 Formal Policy Evaluation

**Formal policy evaluation** transforms static risk assessments into actionable guidance by modeling how specific interventions alter critical parameters. Using causal inference techniques @pearl2000 @pearl2009, we can assess not just the probability of adverse outcomes but how those probabilities change under different policy regimes.

This enables genuinely evidence-based policy development:

- Comparing interventions across multiple worldviews
- Identifying robust strategies that work across scenarios
- Understanding which uncertainties most affect policy effectiveness
- Prioritizing research to reduce decision-relevant uncertainty

### 1.5.4 The Synergy

The multiplicative benefits emerge from the interactions between components:

- Automation enables comprehensive coverage, making prediction market integration more valuable by connecting to more perspectives
- Market data validates and calibrates automated extractions, improving quality
- Policy evaluation gains precision from both comprehensive models and live probability updates
- The complete system creates feedback loops where policy analysis identifies critical uncertainties for market attention

This synergistic combination addresses the coordination crisis by providing common ground for disparate communities, translating between technical and policy languages, quantifying previously implicit disagreements, and enabling evidence-based compromise.

## 1.6 Thesis Structure and Roadmap

<!-- [-] TODO: Preview the logical progression of the thesis -->

The remainder of this thesis develops the multiplicative benefits framework from theoretical foundations to practical implementation:

**Chapter 2: Context and Theoretical Foundations** establishes the intellectual groundwork, examining the epistemic challenges unique to AI governance, Bayesian networks as formal tools for uncertainty representation, argument mapping as a bridge from natural language to formal models, the MTAIR project's achievements and limitations, and requirements for effective coordination infrastructure.

**Chapter 3: AMTAIR Design and Implementation** presents the technical system including overall architecture and design principles, the two-stage extraction pipeline (ArgDown → BayesDown), validation methodology and results, case studies from simple examples to complex AI risk models, and integration with prediction markets and policy evaluation.

**Chapter 4: Discussion - Implications and Limitations** critically examines technical limitations and failure modes, conceptual concerns about formalization, integration with existing governance frameworks, scaling challenges and opportunities, and broader implications for epistemic security.

**Chapter 5: Conclusion** synthesizes key contributions and charts paths forward with a summary of theoretical and practical achievements, concrete recommendations for stakeholders, research agenda for community development, and vision for AI governance with proper coordination infrastructure.

Throughout this progression, I maintain dual focus on theoretical sophistication and practical utility. The framework aims not merely to advance academic understanding but to provide actionable tools for improving coordination in AI governance during this critical period.

Having established the coordination crisis and outlined how automated modeling can address it, we now turn to the theoretical foundations that make this approach possible.

<!-- [-] INTRODUCE: Concise overview of the Literature, Concepts & Terminology introduced in this chapter/thesis-->

This chapter establishes the theoretical and methodological foundations for the AMTAIR approach. We begin by examining a concrete example of structured AI risk assessment—Joseph Carlsmith's power-seeking AI model—to ground our discussion in practical terms. We then explore the unique epistemic challenges of AI governance that render traditional policy analysis inadequate, introduce Bayesian networks as formal tools for representing uncertainty, and examine how argument mapping bridges natural language reasoning and formal models. The chapter concludes by analyzing the MTAIR project's achievements and limitations, motivating the need for automated approaches, and surveying relevant literature across AI risk modeling, governance proposals, and technical methodologies.

## 2.1 AI Existential Risk: The Carlsmith Model

<!-- [-] TODO: Provide overview of Joe Carlsmith's probabilistic model of power-seeking AI -->

To ground our discussion in concrete terms, I examine Joseph Carlsmith's "Is Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk?" as an exemplar of structured reasoning about AI catastrophic risk @carlsmith2022. Carlsmith's analysis stands out for its explicit probabilistic decomposition of the path from current AI development to potential existential catastrophe.

<!-- [-] ADD: @carlsmith2022: "Carlsmith, J. (2022). Is Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk?" --> <!-- [-] Explain CITATION: - as a footnote somewhere in this section - that there are multiple versions of the Carlsmith paper: @carlsmith2024 , @carlsmith2021 , @carlsmith2022 @carlsmith2023 -->

### 2.1.1 Six-Premise Decomposition

<!-- [-] ADD: @clarke2022 citation -->

According to the MTAIR model @clarke2022, Carlsmith decomposes existential risk into a probabilistic chain with explicit estimates^[Multiple versions of Carlsmith's paper exist with slight updates to probability estimates: @carlsmith2021, @carlsmith2022, @carlsmith2024. We primarily reference the version used by the MTAIR team for their extraction. Extended discussion and expert probability estimates can be found on LessWrong.]:

2. **Premise 2**: AI systems pursuing objectives in the world (P≈0.95)(P ≈ 0.95) (P≈0.95)
3. **Premise 3**: Systems with power-seeking instrumental incentives (P≈0.40)(P ≈ 0.40) (P≈0.40)
4. **Premise 4**: Sufficient capability for existential threat (P≈0.65)(P ≈ 0.65) (P≈0.65)
5. **Premise 5**: Misaligned systems despite safety efforts (P≈0.50)(P ≈ 0.50) (P≈0.50)
6. **Premise 6**: Catastrophic outcomes from misaligned power-seeking (P≈0.65)(P ≈ 0.65) (P≈0.65)

**Composite Risk Calculation**: P(doom)≈0.05P(doom) ≈ 0.05 P(doom)≈0.05 (5%)

**Premise 1: APS Systems by 2070** (P≈0.65)(P ≈ 0.65) (P≈0.65) "By 2070, there will be AI systems with Advanced capability, Agentic planning, and Strategic awareness"—the conjunction of capabilities that could enable systematic pursuit of objectives in the world.

**Premise 2: Alignment Difficulty** (P≈0.40)(P ≈ 0.40) (P≈0.40) "It will be harder to build aligned APS systems than misaligned systems that are still attractive to deploy"—capturing the challenge that safety may conflict with capability or efficiency.

**Premise 3: Deployment Despite Misalignment** (P≈0.70)(P ≈ 0.70) (P≈0.70) "Conditional on 1 and 2, we will deploy misaligned APS systems"—reflecting competitive pressures and limited coordination.

**Premise 4: Power-Seeking Behavior** (P≈0.65)(P ≈ 0.65) (P≈0.65) "Conditional on 1-3, misaligned APS systems will seek power in high-impact ways"—based on instrumental convergence arguments.

**Premise 5: Disempowerment Success** (P≈0.40)(P ≈ 0.40) (P≈0.40) "Conditional on 1-4, power-seeking will scale to permanent human disempowerment"—despite potential resistance and safeguards.

**Premise 6: Existential Catastrophe** (P≈0.95)(P ≈ 0.95) (P≈0.95) "Conditional on 1-5, this disempowerment constitutes existential catastrophe"—connecting power loss to permanent curtailment of human potential.

**Overall Risk**: Multiplying through the conditional chain yields P(doom)≈0.05P(doom) ≈ 0.05 P(doom)≈0.05 or 5% by 2070.

This structured approach exemplifies the type of reasoning AMTAIR aims to formalize and automate. While Carlsmith spent months developing this model manually, similar rigor exists implicitly in many AI safety arguments awaiting extraction.

<!-- [-] TODO: Verify manual extraction of Carlsmith model for ground truth with Ella and Johannes -->

### 2.1.2 Why Carlsmith Exemplifies Formalizable Arguments

Carlsmith's model demonstrates several features that make it ideal for formal representation:

**Explicit Probabilistic Structure**: Each premise receives numerical probability estimates with documented reasoning, enabling direct translation to Bayesian network parameters.

**Clear Conditional Dependencies**: The logical flow from capabilities through deployment decisions to catastrophic outcomes maps naturally onto directed acyclic graphs.

**Transparent Decomposition**: Breaking the argument into modular premises allows independent evaluation and sensitivity analysis of each component.

**Documented Reasoning**: Extensive justification for each probability enables extraction of both structure and parameters from the source text.

<!-- [-] ADD: "foreshadowing" of how/why we will pick up with carlsmith model later-->

We will return to Carlsmith's model in Chapter 3 as our primary complex case study, demonstrating how AMTAIR successfully extracts and formalizes this sophisticated multi-level argument.

<!-- [-] LATER TODO: Extract two additional "inside view" world models for comparison --> <!-- [-] ADD: @christiano2019: "Christiano, P. (2019). What failure looks like. AI Alignment Forum." -->

Beyond Carlsmith's model, other structured approaches to AI risk—such as Christiano's "What failure looks like" @christiano2019—provide additional targets for automated extraction, enabling comparative analysis across different expert worldviews.

## 2.2 The Epistemic Challenge of Policy Evaluation

<!-- [-] TODO: Explain why evaluating AI governance policies is particularly difficult -->

AI governance policy evaluation faces unique epistemic challenges that render traditional policy analysis methods insufficient. Understanding these challenges motivates the need for new computational approaches.

### 2.2.1 Unique Characteristics of AI Governance

**Deep Uncertainty Rather Than Risk**: Traditional policy analysis distinguishes between risk (known probability distributions) and uncertainty (known possibilities, unknown probabilities). AI governance faces deep uncertainty—we cannot confidently enumerate possible futures, much less assign probabilities @hallegatte2012. Will recursive self-improvement enable rapid capability gains? Can value alignment be solved technically? These foundational questions resist empirical resolution before their answers become catastrophically relevant.

**Complex Multi-Level Causation**: Policy effects propagate through technical, institutional, and social levels with intricate feedback loops. A technical standard might alter research incentives, shifting capability development trajectories, changing competitive dynamics, and ultimately affecting existential risk through pathways invisible at the policy's inception. Traditional linear causal models cannot capture these dynamics.

**Irreversibility and Lock-In**: Many AI governance decisions create path dependencies that prove difficult or impossible to reverse. Early technical standards shape development trajectories. Institutional structures ossify. International agreements create sticky equilibria. Unlike many policy domains where course correction remains possible, AI governance mistakes may prove permanent.

**Value-Laden Technical Choices**: The entanglement of technical and normative questions confounds traditional separation of facts and values. What constitutes "alignment"? How much capability development should we risk for economic benefits? Technical specifications embed ethical judgments that resist neutral expertise.

### 2.2.2 Limitations of Traditional Approaches

Standard policy evaluation tools prove inadequate for these challenges:

**Cost-Benefit Analysis** assumes commensurable outcomes and stable probability distributions. When potential outcomes include existential catastrophe with deeply uncertain probabilities, the mathematical machinery breaks down. Infinite negative utility resists standard decision frameworks.

**Scenario Planning** helps explore possible futures but typically lacks the probabilistic reasoning needed for decision-making under uncertainty. Without quantification, scenarios provide narrative richness but limited action guidance.

**Expert Elicitation** aggregates specialist judgment but struggles with interdisciplinary questions where no single expert grasps all relevant factors. Moreover, experts often operate with different implicit models, making aggregation problematic.

**Red Team Exercises** test specific plans but miss systemic risks emerging from component interactions. Gaming individual failures cannot reveal emergent catastrophic possibilities.

These limitations create a methodological gap: we need approaches that handle deep uncertainty, represent complex causation, quantify expert disagreement, and enable systematic exploration of intervention effects.

### 2.2.3 The Underlying Epistemic Framework

<!-- [-] OUTLINE AND WRITE: this entire section about Foundation Epistemic Framework — Probabilistic, Conditional, Possible Worlds -->

The AMTAIR approach rests on a specific epistemic framework that combines probabilistic reasoning, conditional logic, and possible worlds semantics. This framework provides the philosophical foundation for representing deep uncertainty about AI futures.

**Probabilistic Epistemology**: Following the Bayesian tradition, we treat probability as a measure of rational credence rather than objective frequency. This subjective interpretation allows meaningful probability assignments even for unique, unprecedented events like AI catastrophe. As E.T. Jaynes demonstrated, probability theory extends deductive logic to handle uncertainty, providing a calculus for rational belief @jaynes2003.

**Conditional Structure**: The framework emphasizes conditional rather than absolute probabilities. Instead of asking "What is P(catastrophe)?" we ask "What is P(catastrophe | specific assumptions)?" This conditionalization makes explicit the dependency of conclusions on worldview assumptions, enabling productive disagreement about premises rather than conclusions.

**Possible Worlds Semantics**: We conceptualize uncertainty as distributions over possible worlds—complete descriptions of how reality might unfold. Each world represents a coherent scenario with specific values for all relevant variables. Probability distributions over these worlds capture both what we know and what we don't know about the future.

This framework enables several key capabilities:

1. **Representing ignorance**: We can express uncertainty about uncertainty itself through hierarchical probability models
2. **Combining evidence**: Bayesian updating provides principled methods for integrating new information
3. **Comparing worldviews**: Different probability distributions over the same space of possibilities enable systematic comparison
4. **Evaluating interventions**: Counterfactual reasoning about how actions change probability distributions

### 2.2.4 Toward New Epistemic Tools

<!-- [-] TODO: Bridge from limitations to the need for automated, computational approaches -->

The inadequacy of traditional methods for AI governance creates an urgent need for new epistemic tools. These tools must:

- **Handle Deep Uncertainty**: Move beyond point estimates to represent ranges of possibilities
- **Capture Complex Causation**: Model multi-level interactions and feedback loops
- **Quantify Disagreement**: Make explicit where experts diverge and why
- **Enable Systematic Analysis**: Support rigorous comparison of policy options

**Key Insight**: The computational approaches developed in this thesis—particularly Bayesian networks enhanced with automated extraction—directly address each of these requirements by providing formal frameworks for reasoning under uncertainty.

Recent work on conditional trees demonstrates the value of structured approaches to uncertainty. McCaslin et al. @mccaslin2024 show how hierarchical conditional forecasting can identify high-value questions for reducing uncertainty about complex topics like AI risk. Their methodology, which asks experts to produce simplified Bayesian networks of informative forecasting questions, achieved nine times higher information value than standard forecasting platform questions.

<!-- [-] ADD: @tetlock2022 cite and explain their use of metaculus prediction markets -->

Tetlock's work with the Forecasting Research Institute @tetlock2022 exemplifies how prediction markets can provide empirical grounding for formal models. By structuring questions as conditional trees, they enable forecasters to express complex dependencies between events, providing exactly the type of data needed for Bayesian network parameterization.

<!-- [-] ADD @gruetzemacher2022 cite and summarize the relevant aspects -->

Gruetzemacher @gruetzemacher2022 evaluates the tradeoffs between full Bayesian networks and conditional trees for forecasting tournaments. While conditional trees offer simplicity, Bayesian networks provide richer representation of dependencies—motivating AMTAIR's approach of using full networks while leveraging conditional tree insights for question generation.

## 2.3 Bayesian Networks as Knowledge Representation

<!-- [-] TODO: Introduce Bayesian networks as formal tools for representing uncertainty -->

Bayesian networks offer a mathematical framework uniquely suited to addressing these epistemic challenges. By combining graphical structure with probability theory, they provide tools for reasoning about complex uncertain domains.

### 2.3.1 Mathematical Foundations

A Bayesian network consists of:

- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: Nodes represent variables, edges represent direct dependencies
- **Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs)**: For each node, P(node|parents) quantifies relationships

The joint probability distribution factors according to the graph structure:

<!-- [-] CHECK: if this equation is correct -->

P(X1,X2,...,Xn)=∏i=1nP(Xi∣Parents(Xi))P(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i | Parents(X_i))P(X1​,X2​,...,Xn​)=i=1∏n​P(Xi​∣Parents(Xi​))

This factorization enables efficient inference and embodies causal assumptions explicitly.

<!-- [-] ADD: @pearl2014: "Pearl, J. (2014). Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems: Networks of plausible Inference" -->

Pearl's foundational work @pearl2014 established Bayesian networks as a principled approach to automated reasoning under uncertainty, providing both theoretical foundations and practical algorithms.

### 2.3.2 The Rain-Sprinkler-Grass Example

<!-- [-] CHANGE ORDER: of Rain-sprinkler-grass example and argument mapping section-->

The canonical example illustrates key concepts^[This example, while simple, demonstrates all essential features of Bayesian networks and serves as the foundation for understanding more complex applications]:

<!-- [-] EXPAND: Use this to elaborate and explain "from DAGs to Bayesian Networks" -->

```
[Grass_Wet]: Concentrated moisture on grass. 
 + [Rain]: Water falling from sky.
 + [Sprinkler]: Artificial watering system.
   + [Rain]
```

Network Structure:

- **Rain** (root cause): P(rain) = 0.2
- **Sprinkler** (intermediate): P(sprinkler|rain) varies by rain state
- **Grass_Wet** (effect): P(wet|rain, sprinkler) depends on both causes

<!-- [-] CREATE: Mermaid flowchart of Rain-Sprinkler-Grass model with probabilities (in correct Quarto Syntax)-->

        G3[P(wet|¬rain,sprinkler) = 0.9]
        G4[P(wet|¬rain,¬sprinkler) = 0.01]
    end
```

python

```python
# Basic network representation
nodes = ['Rain', 'Sprinkler', 'Grass_Wet']
edges = [('Rain', 'Sprinkler'), ('Rain', 'Grass_Wet'), ('Sprinkler', 'Grass_Wet')]

# Conditional probability specification
P_wet_given_causes = {
    (True, True): 0.99,    # Rain=T, Sprinkler=T
    (True, False): 0.80,   # Rain=T, Sprinkler=F  
    (False, True): 0.90,   # Rain=F, Sprinkler=T
    (False, False): 0.01   # Rain=F, Sprinkler=F
}
```

This simple network demonstrates:

- **Marginal Inference**: P(grass_wet) computed from joint distribution
- **Diagnostic Reasoning**: P(rain|grass_wet) reasoning from effects to causes
- **Intervention Modeling**: P(grass_wet|do(sprinkler=on)) for policy analysis
