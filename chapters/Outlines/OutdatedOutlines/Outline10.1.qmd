# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

## The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance {#sec-coordination-crisis}

<!-- Frame the fundamental problem: unprecedented AI capabilities emerging alongside systematic coordination failures -->

`Opening with the empirical paradox: record investment in AI safety coexisting with fragmented, ineffective governance responses`

> @yudkowsky2008, @bostrom2014, @carlsmith2021 establish the stakes of coordination failure

- **The Fragmentation Problem**: Technical researchers, policy specialists, and strategic analysts operate with incompatible frameworks
- **Systemic Risk Amplification**: How coordination failures systematically increase existential risk through safety gaps and resource misallocation
- **The Scaling Challenge**: Traditional governance approaches cannot match the pace of capability development

<!-- [ ] Establish urgency through concrete examples of coordination failures -->






## Research Question and Novel Contribution {#sec-research-question}

**Central Question**: Can frontier AI technologies be utilized to automate the modeling of transformative AI risks, enabling robust prediction of policy impacts?

`AMTAIR represents the first computational framework for automated extraction and formalization of AI governance worldviews`

**Core Innovation**:

- Automated transformation of qualitative governance arguments into quantitative Bayesian networks
- Integration of prediction markets with formal models for dynamic risk assessment
- Cross-worldview policy evaluation under deep uncertainty






## The Multiplicative Benefits Framework {#sec-multiplicative-framework}

<!-- Establish the central thesis about synergistic combination of capabilities -->

**Three Synergistic Components**:

1. **Automated Extraction**: Scaling formal modeling from manual (MTAIR) to automated approaches
2. **Live Data Integration**: Connecting models to prediction markets and forecasting platforms
3. **Policy Evaluation**: Enabling rigorous counterfactual analysis of governance interventions

`The combination creates multiplicative rather than additive value—automation enables comprehensive data integration, markets inform models, evaluation gains precision from both`

# Context & Background {#sec-context}

## Theoretical Foundations {#sec-theoretical-foundations}

### AI Existential Risk: The Carlsmith Model {#sec-carlsmith-model}

> @carlsmith2021 provides the canonical structured approach to AI existential risk assessment

**Six Key Premises Analysis**:

- (1) Transformative AI development this century (80% probability)
- (2) AI systems pursuing objectives in the world (95% probability)
- (3) Systems with power-seeking instrumental incentives (40% probability)
- (4) Sufficient capability for existential threat (65% probability)
- (5) Misaligned systems despite safety efforts (50% probability)
- (6) Catastrophic outcomes from misaligned power-seeking (65% probability)

**Composite Risk Calculation**: ~5% probability of existential catastrophe

`Carlsmith's model exemplifies the type of structured reasoning that AMTAIR aims to formalize and automate`

#### Why Carlsmith as Ideal Formalization Target {#sec-carlsmith-ideal}

```
- Explicitly probabilistic reasoning with quantified estimates
- Clear conditional dependencies between premises  
- Transparent decomposition of complex causal pathways
- Well-documented argumentation available for extraction validation
- Policy-relevant implications requiring formal evaluation
```











### The Epistemic Challenge of Policy Evaluation {#sec-epistemic-challenge}



#### Unique Difficulties in AI Governance {#sec-unique-difficulties}

**Complex Causal Chains**: Multi-level dependencies between technical capabilities, institutional responses, and strategic outcomes

**Deep Uncertainty**: Unprecedented AI capabilities make historical analogies insufficient

> @lempert2003 on robust decision-making under deep uncertainty

**Divergent Worldviews**: Fundamental disagreements about:

- Timeline expectations for transformative AI
- Difficulty of alignment problems
- Effectiveness of governance interventions
- International coordination possibilities





#### Limitations of Traditional Policy Analysis {#sec-traditional-limitations}

<!-- Critical assessment of existing approaches -->

- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Struggles with existential outcomes and infinite expected values
- **Scenario Planning**: Lacks probabilistic reasoning and uncertainty quantification
- **Expert Elicitation**: Fails to formalize complex interdependencies between variables
- **Qualitative Frameworks**: Obscure crucial assumptions and parameter sensitivities





### Bayesian Networks as Knowledge Representation {#sec-bayesian-networks}

#### Mathematical Foundations {#sec-mathematical-foundations}

**Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**:

- Nodes represent variables with discrete states
- Edges represent conditional dependencies
- Acyclicity ensures coherent probabilistic interpretation

**Probability Factorization**: $P(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i | Parents(X_i))$

#### The Rain-Sprinkler-Grass Example {#sec-rain-sprinkler-example}

<!-- Introduce canonical example used throughout thesis -->

`This simple example demonstrates all key concepts while remaining intuitive`

**Network Structure**:

- **Rain** (root cause): P(rain) = 0.2
- **Sprinkler** (intermediate): P(sprinkler|rain) varies by rain state
- **Grass_Wet** (effect): P(wet|rain, sprinkler) depends on both causes

**Inference Capabilities**:

- Marginal probabilities: P(grass_wet) = ?
- Conditional queries: P(rain|grass_wet) = ?
- Counterfactual analysis: P(grass_wet|do(sprinkler=false)) = ?

```python
# Basic network representation
nodes = ['Rain', 'Sprinkler', 'Grass_Wet']
edges = [('Rain', 'Sprinkler'), ('Rain', 'Grass_Wet'), ('Sprinkler', 'Grass_Wet')]
```

#### Advantages for AI Risk Modeling {#sec-modeling-advantages}

## Final Reflections {#sec-final-reflections}








### The Coordination Imperative {#sec-coordination-imperative}

The research presented here represents both an opportunity and a necessity. As AI capabilities advance toward and potentially beyond human-level intelligence, the window for establishing effective governance becomes increasingly constrained. The coordination failures documented throughout this thesis—fragmented communities, incompatible frameworks, resource misallocation—pose existential risks comparable to the technical challenges of AI alignment itself.

AMTAIR offers a concrete path forward: computational tools that make implicit models explicit, enable systematic comparison across worldviews, and support evidence-based evaluation of governance interventions. The prototype demonstrates technical feasibility; the case studies validate practical utility; the analysis reveals both opportunities and limitations.







### Beyond Technical Solutions {#sec-beyond-technical}

Yet technology alone cannot solve coordination problems rooted in human psychology, institutional incentives, and political dynamics. The formal models enable better reasoning but cannot substitute for wisdom, judgment, and democratic deliberation. Success requires integrating computational tools with existing governance institutions while remaining vigilant against technocratic capture or false precision.

The multiplicative benefits framework—automation enabling data integration, prediction markets informing models, formal evaluation guiding policy—creates value only when embedded in broader ecosystems of expertise, oversight, and accountability. AMTAIR represents infrastructure for coordination, not coordination itself.







### The Path Forward {#sec-path-forward}

The stakes could hardly be higher. If advanced AI systems emerge without adequate governance, the consequences may prove irreversible. If governance systems prove too slow or fragmented to respond effectively, we risk losing control over humanity's technological trajectory precisely when that control matters most.

This thesis demonstrates one approach to enhancing coordination through better epistemic tools. Whether it proves sufficient depends on adoption, refinement, and integration with broader governance efforts. The window for action remains open, but it may not remain so indefinitely.

`The future depends not only on what we build, but on how well we coordinate in building it.`
