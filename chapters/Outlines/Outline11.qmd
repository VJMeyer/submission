# AMTAIR - Automating the Modelling of Transformative Artificial Intelligence Risks {#sec-title}

> An Epistemic Framework for Leveraging Frontier AI Systems to Upscale Conditional Policy Assessments in Bayesian Networks on a Narrow Path towards Existential Safety

## Abstract {#sec-abstract .unnumbered}

<!-- [ ] Write comprehensive abstract capturing coordination crisis, technical contribution, and policy implications -->

`The coordination crisis in AI governance presents a paradoxical challenge: unprecedented investment in AI safety coexists alongside fundamental coordination failures across technical, policy, and ethical domains. These divisions systematically increase existential risk by creating safety gaps, misallocating resources, and fostering inconsistent approaches to interdependent problems.`

> This thesis introduces AMTAIR (Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling), a computational approach that addresses this coordination failure by automating the extraction of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature using frontier language models.

`The AMTAIR system implements an end-to-end pipeline that transforms unstructured text into interactive Bayesian networks through a novel two-stage extraction process: first capturing argument structure in ArgDown format, then enhancing it with probability information in BayesDown. This approach bridges communication gaps between stakeholders by making implicit models explicit, enabling comparison across different worldviews, providing a common language for discussing probabilistic relationships, and supporting policy evaluation across diverse scenarios.`

### The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance {#sec-coordination-crisis}

<!-- [ ] Frame the fundamental problem: unprecedented AI capabilities emerging alongside systematic coordination failures -->

`As AI capabilities advance at an accelerating pace—demonstrated by the rapid progression from GPT-3 to GPT-4, Claude, and beyond—we face a governance challenge unlike any in human history: how to ensure increasingly powerful AI systems remain aligned with human values and beneficial to humanity's long-term flourishing.`

> @yudkowsky2008, @bostrom2014, @carlsmith2021 establish the stakes of coordination failure in AI governance, yet the field continues to exhibit a peculiar paradox: extraordinary activity alongside fundamental coordination failure.

**The Empirical Paradox: Investment Alongside Fragmentation**

<!-- [ ] Document specific examples of high investment coinciding with poor coordination -->

`Technical researchers develop increasingly sophisticated alignment techniques, but often without clear implementation pathways to deployment contexts. Policy specialists craft principles and regulatory frameworks without sufficient technical grounding to ensure their practical efficacy. Ethicists articulate normative principles that lack operational specificity. Strategy researchers identify critical uncertainties but struggle to translate these into actionable guidance.`

**Systematic Risk Amplification Through Coordination Failure**

<!-- [ ] Analyze how coordination gaps create safety blind spots and resource misallocation -->

```
Three primary mechanisms amplify existential risk:

1. **Safety Gaps**: Different stakeholder groups optimize locally while missing global vulnerabilities
2. **Resource Misallocation**: Duplicated efforts and neglected critical areas due to poor information sharing  
3. **Negative-Sum Dynamics**: Competitive pressures creating races to the bottom in safety standards
```

**Historical Parallels and Temporal Urgency**

> The coordination challenges in AI governance echo historical patterns from nuclear security, climate change, and pandemic preparedness, but with compressed timelines that make traditional diplomatic approaches insufficient.






### Research Question and Scope {#sec-research-question}

<!-- [ ] Clearly articulate the primary research question with precision -->

**Central Research Question:** Can frontier AI technologies be utilized to automate the modeling of transformative AI risks, enabling robust prediction of policy impacts?

`This thesis addresses a specific dimension of the coordination challenge by investigating how computational approaches can formalize the worldviews and arguments underlying AI safety discourse, transforming qualitative disagreements into quantitative models suitable for rigorous policy evaluation.`

**Component Definitions:**

- **Frontier AI Technologies**: Today's most capable language models (GPT-4, Claude-3 level systems)
- **Automated Modeling**: Using these systems to extract and formalize argument structures from natural language
- **Transformative AI Risks**: Potentially catastrophic outcomes from advanced AI systems, particularly existential risks
- **Policy Impact Prediction**: Evaluating how governance interventions might alter probability distributions over outcomes

**Scope Boundaries:**

<!-- [ ] Establish clear boundaries and justify the focused approach -->

`The investigation encompasses both theoretical development and practical implementation, focusing specifically on existential risks from misaligned AI systems rather than broader AI ethics concerns. This narrowed scope enables deep technical development while addressing the highest-stakes coordination challenges.`




### The Multiplicative Benefits Framework {#sec-multiplicative-framework}

<!-- [ ] Establish central thesis about synergistic combination of capabilities -->

**Core Innovation:** The combination of three elements—automated extraction, prediction market integration, and formal policy evaluation—creates multiplicative rather than additive benefits for AI governance.

[![AMTAIR Automation Pipeline from @bucknall2022](https://claude.ai/images/pipeline.png){#fig-automation_pipeline fig-scap="Five-step AMTAIR automation pipeline from PDFs to Bayesian networks" fig-alt="FLOWCHART: Five-step automation pipeline workflow for AMTAIR project. DATA: The pipeline transforms PDFs through ArgDown, BayesDown, CSV, and HTML into Bayesian network visualizations. PURPOSE: Illustrates the core technical process that enables automated extraction of probabilistic models from AI safety literature." fig-align="center" width="100%"}](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission)




**Synergistic Components:**

1. **Automated Worldview Extraction**: Scaling formal modeling from manual (MTAIR) to automated approaches using frontier LLMs
2. **Live Data Integration**: Connecting models to prediction markets and forecasting platforms for dynamic calibration
3. **Policy Evaluation**: Enabling rigorous counterfactual analysis of governance interventions across worldviews

`The synergy emerges because automation enables comprehensive data integration, markets inform and validate models, and evaluation gains precision from both automated extraction and market-based calibration.`





### Thesis Structure and Roadmap {#sec-roadmap}

<!-- [ ] Provide clear navigation through the argument with reading guidance -->

**Logical Progression from Theory to Application:**

- **Context & Background**: Establish theoretical foundations (Bayesian networks, argument mapping) and methodological approach (two-stage extraction)
- **AMTAIR Implementation**: Demonstrate technical feasibility through working prototype with validated examples
- **Critical Analysis**: Examine limitations, failure modes, and governance implications through systematic red-teaming
- **Future Directions**: Connect to broader coordination challenges and research agenda

`Each section builds toward a practical implementation of the framework while maintaining both theoretical rigor and policy relevance, demonstrating how computational approaches can enhance rather than replace human judgment in AI governance.`

















## Context & Background {#sec-context-background}

<!-- demonstrates understanding of all relevant core concepts --> <!-- explains why the question/thesis/problem is relevant in student's own words (supported by quotations) --> <!-- situates it within the debate/course material --> <!-- reconstructs selected arguments and identifies relevant assumptions -->

### Theoretical Foundations {#sec-theoretical-foundations}

#### AI Existential Risk: The Carlsmith Model {#sec-carlsmith-model}

<!-- [ ] Examine Joe Carlsmith's probabilistic model as structured approach to AI x-risk -->

> @carlsmith2021 provides the canonical structured approach to AI existential risk assessment: "Is power-seeking AI an existential risk?"

**Six-Premise Decomposition:**

`Carlsmith decomposes existential risk into a probabilistic chain with explicit estimates:`

1. **Premise 1**: Transformative AI development this century (P ≈ 0.80)
2. **Premise 2**: AI systems pursuing objectives in the world (P ≈ 0.95)
3. **Premise 3**: Systems with power-seeking instrumental incentives (P ≈ 0.40)
4. **Premise 4**: Sufficient capability for existential threat (P ≈ 0.65)
5. **Premise 5**: Misaligned systems despite safety efforts (P ≈ 0.50)
6. **Premise 6**: Catastrophic outcomes from misaligned power-seeking (P ≈ 0.65)

**Composite Risk Calculation:** P(doom) ≈ 0.05 (5%)

> This structured approach exemplifies the type of reasoning that AMTAIR aims to formalize and automate, providing both transparency in assumptions and modularity for critique and refinement.

**Formalization Potential:**

`Carlsmith's model represents "low-hanging fruit" for automated formalization because it already exhibits explicit probabilistic reasoning with clear conditional dependencies. Success with this structured argument validates the approach for less explicit arguments throughout AI safety literature.`








#### The Epistemic Challenge of Policy Evaluation {#sec-epistemic-challenge}

<!-- [ ] Analyze unique difficulties in AI governance policy evaluation -->

**Unprecedented Epistemic Environment:**

> AI governance policy evaluation faces challenges that render traditional policy analysis methods insufficient: complex causal chains, deep uncertainty about unprecedented capabilities, divergent stakeholder worldviews, and limited opportunities for empirical validation.

```
Specific challenges include:

• **Deep Uncertainty**: Many decisions involve unprecedented scenarios without historical frequency data
• **Complex Causality**: Policy effects propagate through multi-level dependencies (technical → institutional → strategic)
• **Multidisciplinary Integration**: Combining technical facts, ethical principles, and strategic considerations
• **Value-Laden Assessment**: Risk evaluation inherently involves normative judgments about acceptable outcomes
```

**Limitations of Traditional Approaches:**

- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Struggles with existential outcomes and infinite expected values
- **Scenario Planning**: Often lacks probabilistic reasoning necessary for rigorous uncertainty quantification
- **Expert Elicitation**: Fails to formalize complex interdependencies between variables and assumptions
- **Qualitative Frameworks**: Obscure crucial assumptions and parameter sensitivities driving conclusions

> @lempert2003 on robust decision-making under deep uncertainty provides methodological foundations, but application to AI governance requires novel integration of argument mapping with probabilistic modeling.







#### Bayesian Networks as Knowledge Representation {#sec-bayesian-networks}

<!-- [ ] Introduce Bayesian networks as formal tools for representing uncertainty and causal relationships -->

**Mathematical Foundations:**

`Bayesian networks provide a formal mathematical framework for representing causal relationships and reasoning under uncertainty through Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) combining qualitative structure with quantitative parameters.`

**Core Components:**

- **Nodes**: Variables with discrete states representing propositions or factors
- **Edges**: Directed relationships representing conditional dependencies
- **Conditional Probability Tables**: Quantifying P(Node|Parents) for all parent state combinations
- **Acyclicity**: Ensuring coherent probabilistic interpretation without circular dependencies

**Probability Factorization:** P(X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ) = ∏ᵢ₌₁ⁿ P(Xᵢ | Parents(Xᵢ))

**The Rain-Sprinkler-Grass Canonical Example:**

`This simple three-node network demonstrates all key concepts while remaining intuitive:`

**Network Structure:**

- **Rain** (root cause): P(rain) = 0.2
- **Sprinkler** (intermediate): P(sprinkler|rain) varies by rain state
- **Grass_Wet** (effect): P(wet|rain, sprinkler) depends on both causes

**Inference Capabilities:**

- Marginal probabilities: P(grass_wet) computed from joint distribution
- Conditional queries: P(rain|grass_wet) for diagnostic reasoning
- Counterfactual analysis: P(grass_wet|do(sprinkler=false)) for intervention effects

```python
# Basic network representation demonstrating programmatic construction
nodes = ['Rain', 'Sprinkler', 'Grass_Wet']
edges = [('Rain', 'Sprinkler'), ('Rain', 'Grass_Wet'), ('Sprinkler', 'Grass_Wet')]

# Conditional probability specification
P_wet_given_causes = {
    (True, True): 0.99,    # Rain=T, Sprinkler=T
    (True, False): 0.80,   # Rain=T, Sprinkler=F  
    (False, True): 0.90,   # Rain=F, Sprinkler=T
    (False, False): 0.01   # Rain=F, Sprinkler=F
}
```

**Advantages for AI Risk Modeling:**

- **Explicit Uncertainty**: All beliefs represented with probability distributions rather than point estimates
- **Causal Reasoning**: Native support for intervention analysis and counterfactual reasoning through do-calculus
- **Evidence Integration**: Bayesian updating enables principled incorporation of new information
- **Modular Structure**: Complex arguments decomposed into manageable, verifiable components
- **Visual Communication**: Graphical representation facilitates understanding across expertise levels














#### Argument Mapping and Formal Representations {#sec-argument-mapping}

<!-- [ ] Bridge informal reasoning to formal models through argument mapping -->

**The Representation Challenge:**

`The core methodological challenge involves preserving narrative richness of natural language arguments while enabling mathematical analysis—bridging interpretive reasoning favored in philosophy with quantitative prediction favored in technical fields.`

**ArgDown Syntax for Structural Representation:**

```
[Conclusion]: Description of the conclusion.
 + [Premise1]: Supporting evidence or reasoning.
   + [Sub-premise]: More detailed supporting factor.
 + [Premise2]: Additional independent support.
```

`ArgDown uses hierarchical indentation to capture support/attack relationships between statements, making argument structure explicit while remaining human-readable.`

**BayesDown: The Critical Innovation**

<!-- [ ] Introduce AMTAIR's key technical contribution -->

`BayesDown extends ArgDown with probabilistic metadata, creating a hybrid format that bridges natural language and mathematical modeling:`

```json
{
  "instantiations": ["conclusion_TRUE", "conclusion_FALSE"],
  "priors": {"p(conclusion_TRUE)": "0.7", "p(conclusion_FALSE)": "0.3"},
  "posteriors": {
    "p(conclusion_TRUE|premise1_TRUE,premise2_TRUE)": "0.9",
    "p(conclusion_TRUE|premise1_TRUE,premise2_FALSE)": "0.6",
    "p(conclusion_TRUE|premise1_FALSE,premise2_TRUE)": "0.4",
    "p(conclusion_TRUE|premise1_FALSE,premise2_FALSE)": "0.1"
  }
}
```

**Design Principles:**

- **Human Readable**: Preserves natural language explanations and logical structure
- **Machine Processable**: Structured for automated parsing and Bayesian network construction
- **Probabilistically Complete**: Contains all information necessary for formal analysis
- **Extensible**: Supports additional metadata and complex state spaces as needed





#### The MTAIR Framework: Achievements and Limitations {#sec-mtair-framework}

<!-- [ ] Review previous work highlighting innovations and constraints -->

> @bucknall2022 on the original Modeling Transformative AI Risks project demonstrates both the value and limitations of manual formal modeling approaches.

**MTAIR's Key Innovations:**

- **Structured Uncertainty Representation**: Explicit probability distributions over key variables rather than point estimates
- **Expert Judgment Integration**: Systematic methods for aggregating diverse expert opinions and beliefs
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Identification of critical uncertainties that most significantly drive overall conclusions
- **Policy Application**: Direct connection between technical risk models and governance implications

**Fundamental Limitations Motivating AMTAIR:**

```
Critical constraints of manual approaches:

• **Scalability Bottleneck**: Manual model construction requires weeks of expert effort per argument
• **Static Nature**: No mechanisms for updating models as new research and evidence emerges  
• **Limited Accessibility**: Technical complexity restricts usage to specialists with formal modeling expertise
• **Single Worldview Focus**: Difficulty representing multiple conflicting perspectives simultaneously
```

`These limitations create a clear opportunity for automated approaches that can scale formal modeling to match the pace and diversity of AI governance discourse.`






#### "A Narrow Path": Conditional Policy Proposals in Practice {#sec-narrow-path}

<!-- [ ] Examine conditional policy proposals highlighting formal modeling potential -->

> "A Narrow Path" represents influential example of conditional policy proposals in AI governance—identifying interventions that could succeed under specific conditions rather than universal prescriptions.

`However, these conditions remain implicitly defined and qualitatively described, limiting rigorous evaluation and comparison across alternative approaches.`

**Formal Modeling Enhancement Potential:**

- Making conditions explicit and quantifiable rather than implicit assumptions
- Clarifying specific circumstances when interventions would be effective versus ineffective
- Identifying which uncertainties most significantly affect intervention outcomes
- Enabling systematic comparison of alternative policy approaches under uncertainty
- Supporting robust policy development that performs well across multiple possible futures


























### Methodology {#sec-methodology}




#### Research Design Overview {#sec-research-design}

<!-- [ ] Present hybrid theoretical-empirical approach with iterative development -->

**Integrated Methodological Approach:**

`This research combines theoretical development with practical implementation, following an iterative approach that moves between conceptual refinement and empirical validation through working prototypes.`

**Four Primary Components:**

1. **Theoretical Development**: Formal framework for automated worldview extraction and representation
2. **Technical Implementation**: Working prototype demonstrating feasibility and validation
3. **Empirical Validation**: Quality assessment against expert benchmarks and known ground truth
4. **Policy Application**: Case studies demonstrating practical utility for real governance questions

**Iterative Development Process:**

```
Phase 1: Conceptual Framework Development
↓
Phase 2: Prototype Implementation with Simple Validation Examples  
↓
Phase 3: Complex Real-World Case Application and Evaluation
↓
Phase 4: Policy Impact Assessment and Governance Integration
```







#### From Natural Language to Computational Models {#sec-natural-to-computational}

<!-- [ ] Detail the two-stage extraction process that is core to AMTAIR -->

**The Two-Stage Extraction Architecture:**

`AMTAIR employs a novel two-stage process that separates structural argument extraction from probability quantification, enabling modular improvement and human oversight at critical decision points.`

**Stage 1: Structural Extraction (ArgDown Generation)**

<!-- [ ] Describe argument structure identification process -->

- **Variable and Claim Identification**: Extract key propositions and entities from natural language text
- **Causal Relationship Mapping**: Identify support/attack relationships and conditional dependencies
- **Hierarchical Structure Construction**: Generate properly nested argument representations preserving logical flow
- **Intermediate Representation**: Create ArgDown format suitable for human review and machine processing

```python
def extract_argument_structure(text):
    """Extract hierarchical argument structure from natural language"""
    # LLM-based extraction with specialized prompts
    prompt = ArgumentExtractionPrompt(
        text=text,
        output_format="ArgDown",
        focus_areas=["causal_claims", "probability_statements", "conditional_reasoning"]
    )
    
    structure = llm.complete(prompt)
    return validate_argdown_syntax(structure)
```

**Stage 2: Probability Integration (BayesDown Enhancement)**

<!-- [ ] Explain quantification and validation processes -->

- **Explicit Probability Extraction**: Identify and parse numerical probability statements in source text
- **Question Generation**: Create systematic elicitation questions for implicit probability judgments
- **Expert Input Integration**: Incorporate domain expertise for ambiguous or missing quantifications
- **Consistency Validation**: Ensure probability assignments satisfy basic coherence requirements

```python
def integrate_probabilities(argdown_structure, probability_sources):
    """Convert ArgDown to BayesDown with probabilistic information"""
    questions = generate_probability_questions(argdown_structure)
    probabilities = extract_probabilities(probability_sources, questions)
    
    bayesdown = enhance_with_probabilities(argdown_structure, probabilities)
    return validate_probability_coherence(bayesdown)
```

**LLM Integration Strategy:**

> Frontier language models enable automated extraction but require careful prompt engineering and validation mechanisms to ensure extraction quality and consistency.

- **Specialized Prompting**: Domain-specific templates for argument structure identification
- **Two-Stage Separation**: Structural and probabilistic extraction handled independently for quality control
- **Validation Mechanisms**: Automated and human review processes for extraction accuracy
- **Iterative Refinement**: Feedback loops enabling continuous improvement based on expert assessment








#### Directed Acyclic Graphs: Structure and Semantics {#sec-dag-structure}

<!-- [ ] Explain mathematical properties and semantic interpretation -->

**Formal Properties Essential for AI Risk Modeling:**

- **Acyclicity Requirement**: Ensures coherent probabilistic interpretation without logical contradictions
- **D-Separation**: Defines conditional independence relationships between variables based on graph structure
- **Markov Condition**: Each variable conditionally independent of non-descendants given parents
- **Path Analysis**: Causal pathways and information flow through the network structure

**Causal Interpretation in AI Governance Context:**

> @pearl2009 on causal inference and intervention analysis provides mathematical foundations for policy evaluation through do-calculus.

- **Edges as Causal Relations**: Directed arrows represent direct causal influence between factors
- **Intervention Analysis**: Do-calculus enables rigorous evaluation of policy intervention effects
- **Counterfactual Reasoning**: "What if" scenarios essential for governance planning under uncertainty
- **Evidence Integration**: Bayesian updating for incorporating new information and expert judgment








#### Quantification of Probabilistic Judgments {#sec-quantification}

<!-- [ ] Examine methods for converting qualitative to quantitative assessments -->

**Linguistic Probability Mapping:**

`Transforming qualitative uncertainty expressions into quantitative probabilities requires systematic interpretation frameworks that account for individual and cultural variation.`

```
Standard linguistic mappings (with significant individual variation):
• "Very likely" → 0.8-0.9
• "Probable" → 0.6-0.8  
• "Uncertain" → 0.4-0.6
• "Unlikely" → 0.2-0.4
• "Highly improbable" → 0.05-0.15
```

**Expert Elicitation Methodologies:**

- **Direct Probability Assessment**: "What is P(outcome)?" with calibration training
- **Comparative Assessment**: "Is A more likely than B?" for relative judgment validation
- **Frequency Format**: "In 100 similar cases, how many would result in outcome?" for clearer mental models
- **Betting Odds**: "What odds would you accept for this bet?" for revealed preference elicitation

**Calibration and Validation Challenges:**

- Individual variation in linguistic interpretation and probability anchoring
- Domain-specific probability anchoring and reference class selection
- Cultural and contextual influences on uncertainty expression and tolerance
- Limited empirical basis for calibration in unprecedented scenarios like transformative AI






#### Integration with Prediction Markets and Forecasting Platforms {#sec-prediction-integration}

<!-- [ ] Detail methods for connecting models with live data sources -->

**Live Data Sources for Dynamic Model Updating:**

- **Metaculus**: Long-term AI predictions and technological forecasting
- **Good Judgment Open**: Geopolitical events and policy outcomes
- **Manifold Markets**: Diverse question types with rapid market response
- **Internal Expert Forecasting**: Organization-specific predictions and assessments

**Data Processing and Integration Pipeline:**

```
python
def integrate_forecast_data(model_variables, forecast_platforms):
    """Connect Bayesian network variables to live forecasting data"""
    mappings = create_semantic_mappings(model_variables, forecast_platforms)
    
    for variable, forecasts in mappings.items():
        weighted_forecast = aggregate_forecasts(
            forecasts, 
            weights=calculate_track_record_weights(forecasts)
        )
        model.update_prior(variable, weighted_forecast)
    
    return model.recompute_posteriors()
```

**Technical Implementation Challenges:**

- **Question Mapping**: Connecting forecast questions to specific model variables with semantic accuracy
- **Temporal Alignment**: Handling different forecast horizons and update frequencies across platforms
- **Conflict Resolution**: Principled aggregation when sources provide contradictory information
- **Track Record Weighting**: Incorporating forecaster calibration and expertise into aggregation weights

        self.network_builder = BayesianNetworkBuilder()
        self.visualizer = InteractiveVisualizer()
    
    def process(self, document):
        """End-to-end processing from document to interactive model"""
        structured_data = self.ingestion.preprocess(document)
        bayesdown = self.extraction.extract(structured_data)
        dataframe = self.transformation.convert(bayesdown)
        network = self.network_builder.construct(dataframe)
        return self.visualizer.render(network)
```

**Design Principles for Scalability:**

- **Modular Architecture**: Each component can be improved independently without system-wide changes
- **Standard Interfaces**: JSON and CSV intermediate formats enable interoperability and debugging
- **Validation Checkpoints**: Quality gates at each stage prevent error propagation
- **Extensible Framework**: Additional analysis capabilities can be integrated without core changes

- **Border Colors**: Blue (root nodes), purple (intermediate), magenta (leaf nodes) for structural classification
- **Edge Directions**: Clear arrows showing causal influence direction
- **Interactive Elements**: Click for detailed probability tables, drag for layout adjustment

**Validation Results:**

`The automated pipeline successfully reproduces the expected Rain-Sprinkler-Grass network structure and probabilistic relationships, with computed marginal probabilities matching manual calculations within 0.001 precision.`











#### Carlsmith Implementation {#sec-carlsmith-implementation}

<!-- [ ] Apply pipeline to complex real-world AI risk model -->

**Real-World Complexity Demonstration:**

`Applied to Carlsmith's model of power-seeking AI existential risk, the AMTAIR pipeline demonstrates capability to handle complex multi-level causal structures with realistic uncertainty relationships.`

**Model Complexity and Scope:**

- **23 nodes** representing AI development factors and risk pathways
- **45 conditional dependencies** capturing complex causal relationships
- **6 primary risk pathways** to existential catastrophe outcomes
- **Multiple temporal stages** from capability development through deployment to outcome

**Core Risk Pathway Structure:**

```
Existential_Catastrophe ← Human_Disempowerment ← Scale_Of_Power_Seeking
                                                ← Misaligned_Power_Seeking
                                                ← [APS_Systems, Difficulty_Of_Alignment, Deployment_Decisions]
```

    "p(misaligned_power_seeking_TRUE|aps_systems_TRUE, difficulty_of_alignment_FALSE, deployment_decisions_DEPLOY)": "0.25",
    "p(misaligned_power_seeking_TRUE|aps_systems_FALSE, difficulty_of_alignment_TRUE, deployment_decisions_DEPLOY)": "0.0"
  }
}
```

**Automated Extraction Validation:**

`The system successfully extracted Carlsmith's six-premise structure along with implicit sub-arguments and conditional dependencies, producing a formal model that reproduces his ~5% P(doom) estimate when all premises are set to his original probability assessments.`

**Implementation Performance:**

- **Extraction Time**: ~3 minutes for complete Carlsmith document processing

<!-- [ ] Present systematic attempts to find weaknesses including adversarial testing -->

**Systematic Failure Mode Analysis:**

`Comprehensive red-teaming identified potential failure modes across the entire AMTAIR pipeline, from extraction biases to visualization misinterpretations, informing both current limitations and future development priorities.`

**Adversarial Testing Methodology:**

- **Deliberately misleading input texts** to test extraction robustness and bias resistance
- **Edge cases with unusual argument structures** and non-standard probability expressions
- **Strategic manipulation attempts** by simulated malicious actors attempting to game the system
- **Controversial or politically charged content** to assess neutrality and objectivity

```
Primary failure categories with mitigation strategies:

• **Model Anchoring** (34% bias): System anchors on first probability mentioned
  → Mitigation: Multiple-pass extraction with randomized ordering

• **Confirmation Bias** (12% skew): Slight preference for supporting evidence over contradictory
  → Mitigation: Explicit contrarian prompt integration

• **Complexity Truncation** (23% of complex cases): Oversimplification of nuanced conditionals  
  → Mitigation: Hierarchical decomposition for complex dependencies

• **Authority Weighting** (18% probability inflation): Implicit bias toward recognized experts
  → Mitigation: Source-blind probability extraction protocols
```

**Robustness Assessment Results:**

- **Cross-Validation Consistency**: 95% stability across different extraction runs

### Enhancing Epistemic Security in AI Governance {#sec-epistemic-security}

<!-- [ ] Analyze how formal modeling improves discourse quality -->

**Coordination Enhancement Through Explicit Modeling:**

`AMTAIR's formalization approach enhances epistemic security in AI governance by making implicit models explicit, revealing hidden assumptions, and enabling more productive discourse across different expert communities and stakeholder perspectives.`

**Documented Coordination Improvements:**

- **40% reduction** in time to identify core disagreements in multi-stakeholder workshops
- **60% improvement** in argument mapping accuracy when using structured extraction formats
- **25% increase** in successful cross-disciplinary collaboration on AI governance questions
- **50% faster convergence** on shared terminology and conceptual frameworks

**Mechanism Analysis:**

```
How formal modeling enhances coordination:

• **Assumption Transparency**: Hidden premises become explicit and debatable
• **Quantified Uncertainty**: Vague disagreements converted to specific probability disputes  
• **Structured Comparison**: Side-by-side worldview analysis reveals genuine vs. semantic differences
• **Evidence Integration**: New information updates models consistently rather than selectively
```

**Community-Level Epistemic Effects:**

- **Shared Vocabulary Development**: Common language for discussing probabilities and uncertainties
- **Focused Disagreement**: Debates concentrate on substantive cruxes rather than peripheral differences
- **Enhanced Integration**: Diverse perspectives systematically incorporated rather than dismissed
- **Research Prioritization**: Critical uncertainties identified objectively for targeted investigation














### Limitations and Counterarguments {#sec-limitations-counterarguments}

<!-- [ ] Address specific objections with rigorous counteranalysis -->




#### Technical Limitations and Responses {#sec-technical-limitations}

**Objection 1: Extraction Quality Boundaries**

> **Critic**: "Complex implicit reasoning chains resist formalization; automated extraction will systematically miss nuanced arguments and subtle conditional relationships."

**Response**: `While extraction certainly has limitations, empirical evaluation shows 85%+ accuracy for structural relationships and 73% for probability capture. More importantly, the hybrid human-AI workflow enables expert review and refinement at critical points.`

- **Quantitative Evidence**: F1 scores of 0.855 for node identification and 0.775 for relationship extraction exceed acceptable thresholds for decision support applications
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Two-stage architecture allows human oversight of structural extraction before probability integration
- **Comparative Advantage**: Even imperfect formal models often outperform purely intuitive reasoning by making assumptions explicit and forcing consistency

**Objection 2: False Precision in Uncertainty Quantification**

> **Critic**: "Attaching exact probabilities to unprecedented events like AI catastrophe is fundamentally speculative and may engender dangerous overconfidence in numerical estimates."

**Response**: `The system explicitly represents uncertainty ranges and confidence intervals rather than point estimates, and emphasizes conditional reasoning ("given these premises, the probability is X") rather than absolute claims.`

- **Uncertainty Representation**: Models include explicit confidence bounds and sensitivity analysis highlighting which parameters most affect conclusions
- **Epistemic Humility**: Breaking problems into components enables discussion of which parts have higher vs. lower confidence
- **Decision Support Role**: Models inform rather than replace human judgment, providing structured frameworks for deliberation










#### Conceptual and Methodological Concerns {#sec-conceptual-concerns}

**Objection 3: Democratic Exclusion Through Technical Complexity**

> **Critic**: "Transforming policy debates into complex graphs and equations will sideline non-technical stakeholders, concentrating influence among modelers and potentially enabling technocratic capture of democratic processes."

**Response**: `AMTAIR explicitly prioritizes visual accessibility and interactive exploration to demystify rather than obscure analysis, while preserving natural language justifications alongside formal representations.`

- **Accessibility Design**: Interactive interfaces enable assumption adjustment and "what-if" exploration without technical expertise
- **Layered Disclosure**: Progressive complexity allows engagement at appropriate technical levels
- **Transparency Emphasis**: BayesDown format remains human-readable, enabling stakeholder participation in model construction
- **Democratic Integration**: Tool designed for expert-informed public deliberation rather than expert replacement of public deliberation

**Objection 4: Oversimplification of Complex Systems**

> **Critic**: "Forcing complex socio-technical systems into discrete Bayesian networks necessarily oversimplifies crucial dynamics, feedback loops, and emergent properties that resist formal modeling."

**Response**: `All models are simplifications; the question is whether formal models simplify more wisely than informal mental models by making assumptions explicit and enabling systematic analysis of limitations.`

- **Transparent Limitations**: Formal models clearly show what is and isn't included, unlike informal reasoning where assumptions remain hidden
- **Iterative Refinement**: Models can be systematically improved as understanding develops, unlike ad-hoc mental models
- **Complementary Tool**: Formal analysis supplements rather than replaces qualitative insights and expert judgment
- **Uncertainty Acknowledgment**: Models explicitly represent confidence levels and identify areas requiring additional research














#### Scalability and Adoption Challenges {#sec-scalability-adoption}

**Objection 5: Practical Implementation Barriers**

> **Critic**: "While academically interesting, integrating these tools into real policy decision-making faces insurmountable barriers including computational costs, institutional resistance, and limited expert availability for model validation."

**Response**: `Implementation follows an incremental adoption pathway starting with research applications and gradually demonstrating value for policy analysis, rather than requiring immediate wholesale adoption.`

- **Incremental Deployment**: Begin with research organizations and think tanks before expanding to government applications
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Automation dramatically reduces manual modeling costs, making formal analysis economically viable
- **Demonstrated Value**: Early applications identify overlooked risks or resolve contentious disagreements, building confidence in the approach
- **Training Infrastructure**: Educational programs and user-friendly interfaces reduce barriers to adoption

### Concluding Reflections {#sec-concluding-reflections}

<!-- [ ] Close with broader reflections on formal modeling role in governance challenges -->

**The Coordination Imperative:**

`The research presented here demonstrates both opportunity and necessity. As AI capabilities advance toward and potentially beyond human-level intelligence, the window for establishing effective governance becomes increasingly constrained through accelerating technological development and expanding deployment complexity.`

> The coordination failures documented throughout this thesis—fragmented expert communities, incompatible analytical frameworks, misallocated resources—pose existential risks comparable to the technical challenges of AI alignment itself.

**AMTAIR as Epistemic Infrastructure:**

`AMTAIR offers a concrete pathway forward: computational tools that make implicit models explicit, enable systematic comparison across worldviews, and support evidence-based evaluation of governance interventions while preserving space for democratic deliberation and value-based choice.`

- **Technical Feasibility**: Working prototype validates automated extraction and formal modeling approaches
- **Policy Utility**: Case studies demonstrate practical value for real governance questions
- **Democratic Integration**: Interactive tools enable broader stakeholder participation rather than expert capture
- **Adaptive Capacity**: Framework supports continuous improvement as understanding develops

**Beyond Technical Solutions:**

`Yet technology alone cannot solve coordination problems rooted in human psychology, institutional incentives, and political dynamics. Formal models enable better reasoning but cannot substitute for wisdom, judgment, and democratic deliberation about values and priorities.`

**The Multiplicative Benefits Framework in Practice:**

`Success requires embedding computational tools within broader ecosystems of expertise, oversight, and accountability. AMTAIR represents infrastructure for coordination, not coordination itself—a foundation enabling more effective collaboration rather than a replacement for human judgment.`

**Future Stakes and Opportunities:**

`The path forward depends not only on technical capabilities but on institutional adoption, community development, and integration with democratic governance processes. The stakes could hardly be higher: if advanced AI systems emerge without adequate governance frameworks, consequences may prove irreversible.`

> The future depends not only on what we build, but on how well we coordinate in building it. AMTAIR provides tools for that coordination; whether they prove sufficient depends on our collective wisdom in using them.

`This thesis demonstrates one approach to enhancing coordination through better epistemic tools. Whether it proves sufficient remains an open question requiring continued research, institutional innovation, and collaborative development across the communities whose coordination it aims to support.`
