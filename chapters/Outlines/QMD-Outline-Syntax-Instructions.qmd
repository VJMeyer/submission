# PromptGeneration1



Goal 1: Write Quarto Syntax Instructions & Desiderata / best-practice to go above and beyond in using all working quarto feature to the fullest 
Sub-Goal 1: Complete and Improve the 'Quarto Syntax Section', it should include both the best possible documentation of the correct syntax etc. AND detailed instructions for the best practice application ...

Goal 2: write a readme.md file with documentation of quarto features and best practice in this thesis project

Goal 3: Develop and document the best possible Task management / tracking system possible (@frontmatter and @section) 

Goal 4: Provide a comprehensive checklist to be used when working on the thesis, outline etc. and prompting LLMs to adhere to the described best practice, formatting and syntax as well as the crucial task management

Goal 5: Develop clear "tagging/highlighting" system (using some well suited quarto formatting "practice") to mark points, sections, paragraphs, notes etc. which are already covered better elsewhere (especially important because when merging different sources, seemingly redundant contents should only be deleted after manual confirmation, they must therefore be clearly marked and placed next to their better duplicates ...)

Implicit Goals: make full use of ALL (working) Quarto features :

    * Write detailed, precise and clear instructions for when, why and how to use which quarto "formatting" feature.

    * Always make FULL use of all (4.) levels of headings.

    * Indicate (by doing ?) when/where further sub-headings might be helpful/

    * Clearly describe when, why and how to use indentations.

    * Always keep the section with all graphic inclusions (both realized/outstanding and implemented ones) up-to-date (track changes with comments)

    * Always keep the section with all Citatios (both realized/outstanding and implemented ones) up-to-date (track changes with comments)

    * Always make extreme use of the Glossary

    * Clearly articulate and instruct the correct use, syntax and formatting of lists and enumerations

    * Always make extreme use of the Appendices (they are the place for all contents which are quite relevant but are not making the cut into the thesis body itself -- though they should be referenced, with footnotes etc., liberally!)

    * Ensure to make extensive use of: verbatim code formatting, formatting as markdown blocks, callout blocks, Blockquote Formatting, italics, bold, bold italics, strikethrough, links, cross-references (both sections, figures, tables etc.), diagrams, etc.

    * ALWAYS have full Linebreaks between comments, tasks etc. (ensure to generally err on the side of too many than too few line breaks)

    * Ensure to Absolutely overuse footnotes -- they  are the very very best!!

    



Implicit Goals: Develop a comprehensive plan for using all quarto "orientation" features such as:
    - Table of contents
    - Table of tables
    - Glossary
    - List of Figures
    - List of Abbrevations
    - Appendices
    - ...

}}
</figure_syntax>

For each figure or placeholder, a detailed description that includes:
   - A clear explanation of the figure's content, type, purpose, and meaning
   - For charts or data visualizations: describe the data shown, axes, and key patterns
   - Explain why the figure is included and what readers should look for
   - Highlight any important patterns, anomalies, or key insights
   - Mention the data source and any relevant dates
Always format the description in the correct Syntax.
Ensure the description is formatted correctly, using the syntax provided in the figure_syntax as a guide.

Always include:
```markdown
{{
[![Example Caption/Title 4](/images/cover.png){
    #fig-Unique_identifier_for_crossreferencing
    fig-scap="Short caption 4 list of figures as seen in LoF"

Other animals have stronger muscles or sharper claws, but we have cleverer brains. If machine brains one day come to surpass human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become very powerful. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on us humans than on the gorillas themselves, so the fate of our species then would come to depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence. But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation? To get closer to an answer to this question, we must make our way through a fascinating landscape of topics and considerations.

# Prompt 1


You are tasked with helping a researcher optimize the use of Quarto formatting, syntax and task/project management for writing a thesis.
Your goal is to provide comprehensive instructions on how to effectively use Quarto features, implement best practices, and manage tasks efficiently.
Use the following information and guidelines to assist the researcher:

<quarto_syntax>


{{







# Quarto Syntax {#sec-syntax}

## Main Formatting

### Html Comments

<!-- Comments for comments -->


## Syntax for Tasks


### Tasks with ToDo Tree


#### Simple "One-line tasks"

Use Code ticks and html comment and task format for tasks distinctly visible across all formats including the ToDo-Tree overview:

`<!-- [ ] ToDos for things to do / tasks / reminders (allows "jump to with Taks Tree extension") -->`

Use html comment and task format for open or uncertain tasks, visible in the .qmd file:

<!-- [ ] ToDos for things to do / tasks / reminders (allows "jump to with Taks Tree extension") -->



#### More Complex Tasks with Notes

```         
<!-- [ ] Task Title: short description-->

  More Information about task

  Relevant notes

  Step-by-step implementation Plan

  Etc.

```

#### Completed Tasks

Retain completed tasks in ToDo-Tree by adding an x in the brackets: `[x]`
`<!-- [x] Tasks which have been finished but should remain for later verification -->`

<!-- [x] Tasks which have been finished but should remain for later verification -->


Mark and remove completed tasks from ToDo-Tree by adding a minus in the brackets: `[-]`

`<!-- [-] Tasks which have been finished but should remain visible for later verification -->`

<!-- [-] Tasks which have been finished but should remain for later verification (only in .qmd) -->

#### Missing Citations

`<!-- [ ] FIND: @CITATION_KEY_PURPOSE: "Description of the appropriate/idea source, including ideas /suggestions / search terms etc." -->`

#### Suggested Citation

`<!-- [ ] VERIFY: @CITATION_KEY_SUGGESTED: "Description of the appropriate paper, book, source" [Include BibTex if known] -->`

#### Missing Graphic

`<!-- [ ] FIND: {#fig-GRAPHIC_IDEA}]: "Description of the appropriate/idea source, including ideas /suggestions / search terms etc." -->`

#### Suggested Graphic

`<!-- [ ] VERIFY: {#fig-GRAPHIC_IDEA}: "Description of the appropriate paper, book, source" [Include figure syntax if known] -->`

Missing and/or suggested tables, concepts, explanations as well as other elements should be suggested similarily.

### Task Syntax Examples

`<!-- [ ] (Example short: open and visible in text)   Find and list the names of the MTAIR team-members responsible for the Analytica Implementation -->`



```
<!-- [ ] (Example longer: open and visible in text)    Review/Plan/Discuss integrating Live Prediction Markets -->

  Live prediction market integration requires:
    (1) API connections to platforms (Metaculus, Manifold),
    (2) Question-to-variable mapping algorithms,
    (3) Probability update mechanisms, 
    (4) Handling of market dynamics (thin markets, manipulation).
    Current mentions may overstate readiness or underestimate complexity.
    Need realistic assessment of what's achievable.

  Implementation Steps:
      0. List/mention all relevant platforms with a brief description each
      1. Review all existing prediction market mentions for accuracy
      2. Assess actual API availability and limitations
      3. Describe/explain/discuss how to implement basic proof-of-concept with single platform
      4. Document challenges: question mapping, market interpretation
      5. Create realistic timeline for full implementation
      6. Revise thesis claims to match reality
      7. Add "Future Work" and/or extension section on complete integration
      8. Include descriptions of mockups/designs even if not fully built 
      9. Highlight/discuss the advantages of such integrations
      10. Quickly brainstorm for downsides worth mentioning
```

<!-- [x] (Example: done but remaining as a reminder in .qmd and visible in ToDo Tree until verified)   Verify that the Orcid IDs are correct -->

<!-- [-] (Example: done and verified but remaining as a peristent reminder)  Test and verify correct inclusion and formatting of .md files  -->

### Verbatim Code Formatting

`verbatim code formatting for notes and ideas to be included (here)`

### Code Block formatting

```         
Also code blocks for more extensive notes and ideas to be included and checklists
- test 1. 
- test 2. 
- test 3.
2. second
3. third
```

```         
code
```

Add a language to syntax highlight code blocks:

``` python
1 + 1
```

### Blockquote Formatting

> Blockquote formatting for "Suggested Citations (e.g. carlsmith 2024 on ...)" and/or claims which require a citation (e.g. claim x should be backed-up by a ciation from the literature)

### Tables

| Right | Left | Default | Center |
|------:|:-----|---------|:------:|
|    12 | 12   | 12      |   12   |
|   123 | 123  | 123     |  123   |

## Headings & Potential Headings in Standard Markdown formatting ('\##') {#sec-heading}

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

<!-- Using Headings deeper than 4 requires some LaTeX fix -->

<!-- [ ] Enable Headings 5 & 6 -->

<!-- ##### Heading 5 -->

<!-- ###### Heading 6 -->

## Text Formatting Options

*italics*, **bold**, ***bold italics***

superscript^2^ and subscript~2~

~~strikethrough~~

[This text is highlighted]{.mark}

[This text is underlined]{.underline}

[This text is smallcaps]{.smallcaps}

## Lists

-   unordered list

    -   sub-item 1
    -   sub-item 2
        -   sub-sub-item 1

-   item 2

    Continued (indent 4 spaces)

1.  ordered list
2.  item 2
    i)  sub-item 1
        A.  sub-sub-item 1

## Math

inline math: $E = mc^{2}$

display math:

$$E = mc^{2}$$

If you want to define custom TeX macros, include them within \$\$ delimiters enclosed in a .hidden block. For example:

::: hidden
$$
 \def\RR{{\bf R}}
 \def\bold#1{{\bf #1}}
$$
:::

For HTML math processed using MathJax (the default) you can use the \\def, \\newcommand, \\renewcommand, \\newenvironment, \\renewenvironment, and \\let commands to create your own macros and environments.

## Footnotes

Here is an inline note.[^index-1]

[^index-1]: Inlines notes are easier to write, since you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the note.

Here is a footnote reference,[^index-2]

[^index-2]: Here is the footnote.

Another Text with a footnote[^index-3] but this time a "longnote".

[^index-3]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they belong to the previous footnote.

    ```         
    { some.code }
    ```

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first line. In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it isn't indented.

## Callouts {#sec-callouts}

Quarto's native callouts work without additional packages:

::: note
This is written in a 'note' environment -- but it does not seem to produce any special rendering.
:::

::: callout-note
### Optional Title

Content here
:::

::: callout-note
### Important Note2

This renders perfectly in both HTML and PDF.
:::

Also for markdown:

``` markdown
::: {.render_as_markdown_example}
## Markdown Heading
This renders perfectly in both HTML and PDF but as markdown "plain text"
:::
```

<!-- The benefits and use of in-line LaTeX and HTML are unclear to me. I am not even sure if they work properly. -->
### In-Line HTML

Here's some raw inline HTML: <a>html</a>

## Reference or Embed Code from .ipynb files

#### Code chunks from .ipynb notebooks can be embedded in the .qmd text with:

``` markdown
{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#connect_to_github_repository >}}
```

#### which produces the output of executing the code cell:

{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#connect_to_github_repository >}}

#### including 'echo=true' renders the code of the cell:

``` markdown
{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#connect_to_github_repository echo=true >}}

## Diagrams

Quarto has native support for embedding Mermaid and Graphviz diagrams. This enables you to create flowcharts, sequence diagrams, state diagrams, Gantt charts, and more using a plain text syntax inspired by markdown.

For example, here we embed a flowchart created using Mermaid:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Hard edge] --> B(Round edge)
  B --> C{Decision}
  C --> D[Result one]
  C --> E[Result two]
```

## Section Cross-References {#sec-crossref}

Refer to sections like: @sec-adaptive-governance and @sec-crossref <!-- Using @-sec-REFERENCE_HEADING requires that the .qmd file contains a yml section which details the "numbering" -->

``` markdown
Caveat: refering to sections with @sec-HEADINGS works only for sections with:
## Heading {#sec-HEADINGS}
It does not work for sections with ".unnumbered and/or .unlisted":
## Heading {#sec-HEADINGS .unnumbered .unlisted}
Furthermore the .qmd and/or .md yml settings (~ numbering have to be just right)
```

### Section Numbers

By default, all headings in your document create a numbered section. You customize numbering depth using the number-depth option. For example, to only number sections immediately below the chapter level, use this:

`number-depth: 2`

Note that toc-depth is independent of number-depth (i.e. you can have unnumbered entries in the TOC if they are masked out from numbering by number-depth).

## Instructions / Best practice for inclusion of Figures

<figure_syntax>
{{
[![Example Caption/Title 4](/images/cover.png){
   #fig-Unique_identifier_for_crossreferencing
   fig-scap="Short caption 4 list of figures as seen in LoF"
   fig-alt="Detailed alt text that describes the image content, type, purpose, and meaning.
           [CHART TYPE]: [Short description].
               DATA: [What data is shown, x/y axes].
               PURPOSE: [Why it's included, what to look for].
               DETAILS: [Longer description of patterns, anomalies, or key insights].
               SOURCE: Data from [source name/year and url/link]
           "
   fig-align="left"
   width="30%"
   }](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission)
}}
</figure_syntax>

For each figure or placeholder, a detailed description that includes:
   - A clear explanation of the figure's content, type, purpose, and meaning
   - For charts or data visualizations: describe the data shown, axes, and key patterns
   - Explain why the figure is included and what readers should look for
   - Highlight any important patterns, anomalies, or key insights
   - Mention the data source and any relevant dates
Always format the description in the correct Syntax.
Ensure the description is formatted correctly, using the syntax provided in the figure_syntax as a guide.

Always include:
```markdown
{{
[![Example Caption/Title 4](/images/cover.png){
    #fig-Unique_identifier_for_crossreferencing
    fig-scap="Short caption 4 list of figures as seen in LoF"
    fig-alt="Detailed alt text that describes the image content, type, purpose, and meaning.
            [CHART TYPE]: [Short description].
                DATA: [What data is shown, x/y axes].
                PURPOSE: [Why it's included, what to look for].
                DETAILS: [Longer description of patterns, anomalies, or key insights].
                SOURCE: Data from [source name/year and url/link]
            "
    fig-align="left"
    width="30%"
    }](https://github.com/VJMeyer/submission)
}}
```

Make suggestions for improving the graphic or their use whenever something comes to mind.


### Section to keep track of all Figures

`<!-- [ ] ALWAYS include the "inclusions" of all figures/graphics below -->`
`<!-- [ ] ALWAYS keep the #fig-KEYS up-to-date -->`

  abstract = {The human brain has some capabilities that the brains of other animals lack. It is to these distinctive capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. Other animals have stronger muscles or sharper claws, but we have cleverer brains. If machine brains one day come to surpass human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become very powerful. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on us humans than on the gorillas themselves, so the fate of our species then would come to depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence. But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation? To get closer to an answer to this question, we must make our way through a fascinating landscape of topics and considerations. Read the book and learn about oracles, genies, singletons; about boxing methods, tripwires, and mind crime; about humanity's cosmic endowment and differential technological development; indirect normativity, instrumental convergence, whole brain emulation and technology couplings; Malthusian economics and dystopian evolution; artificial intelligence, and biological cognitive enhancement, and collective intelligence.},

Goal 1: Write Quarto Syntax Instructions & Desiderata / best-practice to go above and beyond in using all working quarto feature to the fullest 
Sub-Goal 1: Complete and Improve the 'Quarto Syntax Section', it should include both the best possible documentation of the correct syntax etc. AND detailed instructions for the best practice application ...

Goal 2: write a readme.md file with documentation of quarto features and best practice in this thesis project

Goal 3: Develop and document the best possible Task management / tracking system possible (@frontmatter and @section) 

Goal 4: Provide a comprehensive checklist to be used when working on the thesis, outline etc. and prompting LLMs to adhere to the described best practice, formatting and syntax as well as the crucial task management

Goal 5: Develop clear "tagging/highlighting" system (using some well suited quarto formatting "practice") to mark points, sections, paragraphs, notes etc. which are already covered better elsewhere (especially important because when merging different sources, seemingly redundant contents should only be deleted after manual confirmation, they must therefore be clearly marked and placed next to their better duplicates ...)

Implicit Goals: make full use of ALL (working) Quarto features :

    * Write detailed, precise and clear instructions for when, why and how to use which quarto "formatting" feature.

    * Always make FULL use of all (4.) levels of headings.

    * Indicate (by doing ?) when/where further sub-headings might be helpful/

    * Clearly describe when, why and how to use indentations.

    * Always keep the section with all graphic inclusions (both realized/outstanding and implemented ones) up-to-date (track changes with comments)

    * Always keep the section with all Citatios (both realized/outstanding and implemented ones) up-to-date (track changes with comments)

    * Always make extreme use of the Glossary

    * Clearly articulate and instruct the correct use, syntax and formatting of lists and enumerations

    * Always make extreme use of the Appendices (they are the place for all contents which are quite relevant but are not making the cut into the thesis body itself -- though they should be referenced, with footnotes etc., liberally!)

    * Ensure to make extensive use of: verbatim code formatting, formatting as markdown blocks, callout blocks, Blockquote Formatting, italics, bold, bold italics, strikethrough, links, cross-references (both sections, figures, tables etc.), diagrams, etc.

    * ALWAYS have full Linebreaks between comments, tasks etc. (ensure to generally err on the side of too many than too few line breaks)

    * Ensure to Absolutely overuse footnotes -- they  are the very very best!!

    



Implicit Goals: Develop a comprehensive plan for using all quarto "orientation" features such as:
    - Table of contents
    - Table of tables
    - Glossary
    - List of Figures
    - List of Abbrevations
    - Appendices
    - ...
