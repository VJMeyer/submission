# Preface {.unnumbered}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Expand preface to include personal journey and acknowledgments -->

This thesis represents the culmination of interdisciplinary research at the intersection of AI safety, formal epistemology, and computational social science. The work emerged from recognizing a fundamental challenge in AI governance: while investment in AI safety research has grown exponentially, coordination between different stakeholder communities remains fragmented, potentially increasing existential risk through misaligned efforts.

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Alternative preface from 11.7"}
The journey from initial concept to working implementation involved iterative refinement based on feedback from advisors, domain experts, and potential users. What began as a technical exercise in automated extraction evolved into a broader framework for enhancing epistemic security in one of humanity's most critical coordination challenges.
:::

I hope this work contributes to building the intellectual and technical infrastructure necessary for humanity to navigate the transition to transformative AI safely. The tools and frameworks presented here are offered in the spirit of collaborative problem-solving, recognizing that the challenges we face require unprecedented cooperation across disciplines, institutions, and worldviews.

# 1. Introduction: The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance {#sec-introduction}

## 1.1 Opening Scenario: The Policymaker's Dilemma {#sec-opening-scenario}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Polish opening scenario for maximum impact -->

Imagine a senior policy advisor preparing recommendations for AI governance legislation. On her desk lie a dozen reports from leading AI safety researchers, each painting a different picture of the risks ahead. One argues that misaligned AI could pose existential risks within the decade, citing complex technical arguments about instrumental convergence and orthogonality. Another suggests these concerns are overblown, emphasizing uncertainty and the strength of existing institutions. A third proposes specific technical standards but acknowledges deep uncertainty about their effectiveness.

::: {.redundant-content data-better-version="Outline_12.2#sec-opening"}
Each report seems compelling in isolation, written by credentialed experts with sophisticated arguments. Yet they reach dramatically different conclusions about both the magnitude of risk and appropriate interventions. The technical arguments involve unfamiliar concepts—mesa-optimization, corrigibility, capability amplification—expressed through different frameworks and implicit assumptions. Time is limited, stakes are high, and the legislation could shape humanity's trajectory for decades.
:::

This scenario plays out daily across government offices, corporate boardrooms, and research institutions worldwide. It exemplifies what I term the "coordination crisis" in AI governance: despite unprecedented attention and resources directed toward AI safety, we lack the epistemic infrastructure to synthesize diverse expert knowledge into actionable governance strategies.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-policymaker-dilemma}: "Visual representation of conflicting expert reports on advisor's desk" -->

## 1.2 The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance {#sec-coordination-crisis}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Frame the problem as coordination failure rather than merely technical challenge -->

As AI capabilities advance at an accelerating pace—demonstrated by the rapid progression from GPT-3 to GPT-4, Claude, and emerging multimodal systems—humanity faces a governance challenge unlike any in history. The task of ensuring increasingly powerful AI systems remain aligned with human values and beneficial to our long-term flourishing grows more urgent with each capability breakthrough. This challenge becomes particularly acute when considering transformative AI systems that could drastically alter civilization's trajectory, potentially including existential risks from misaligned systems pursuing objectives counter to human welfare.

> Despite unprecedented investment in AI safety research, rapidly growing awareness among key stakeholders, and proliferating frameworks for responsible AI development, we face what I'll term the "coordination crisis" in AI governance—a systemic failure to align diverse efforts across technical, policy, and strategic domains into a coherent response proportionate to the risks we face.

The current state of AI governance presents a striking paradox. On one hand, we witness extraordinary mobilization: billions in research funding, proliferating safety initiatives, major tech companies establishing alignment teams, and governments worldwide developing AI strategies. The Asilomar AI Principles garnered thousands of signatures, the EU advances comprehensive AI regulation, and technical researchers produce increasingly sophisticated work on alignment, interpretability, and robustness.

::: {.duplicate-content data-source="Outline_11.7#sec-coordination-crisis"}
Yet alongside this activity, we observe systematic coordination failures that may prove catastrophic. Technical safety researchers develop sophisticated alignment techniques without clear implementation pathways. Policy specialists craft regulatory frameworks lacking technical grounding to ensure practical efficacy. Ethicists articulate normative principles that lack operational specificity. Strategy researchers identify critical uncertainties but struggle to translate these into actionable guidance. International bodies convene without shared frameworks for assessing interventions.
:::

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-coordination-crisis}: "Systems diagram showing fragmentation between AI governance communities" -->

### 1.2.1 Safety Gaps from Misaligned Efforts {#sec-safety-gaps}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Document how fragmentation systematically increases risk through specific examples -->

The fragmentation problem manifests in incompatible frameworks between technical researchers, policy specialists, and strategic analysts. Each community develops sophisticated approaches within their domain, yet translation between domains remains primitive. This creates systematic blind spots where risks emerge at the interfaces between technical capabilities, institutional responses, and strategic dynamics.

When different communities operate with incompatible frameworks, critical risks fall through the cracks. Technical researchers may solve alignment problems under assumptions that policymakers' decisions invalidate. Regulations optimized for current systems may inadvertently incentivize dangerous development patterns. Without shared models of the risk landscape, our collective efforts resemble the parable of blind men describing an elephant—each accurate within their domain but missing the complete picture.

<!-- [ ] FIND: @coordination-failure-examples: "Specific historical examples of coordination failures in technology governance" -->

### 1.2.2 Resource Misallocation {#sec-resource-misallocation}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Provide concrete statistics on research funding, publications, and initiatives -->

The AI safety community duplicates efforts while leaving critical areas underexplored. Multiple teams independently develop similar frameworks without building on each other's work. Funders struggle to identify high-impact opportunities across technical and governance domains. Talent flows toward well-publicized approaches while neglected strategies remain understaffed. This misallocation becomes more costly as the window for establishing effective governance narrows.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#tbl-resource-duplication}: "Examples of duplicated AI safety efforts across organizations" -->

### 1.2.3 Negative-Sum Dynamics {#sec-negative-sum}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Address capability-governance gaps widening with accelerating development -->

Perhaps most concerning, uncoordinated interventions can actively increase risk. Safety standards that advantage established players may accelerate risky development elsewhere. Partial transparency requirements might enable capability advances without commensurate safety improvements. International agreements lacking shared technical understanding may lock in dangerous practices. Without coordination, our cure risks becoming worse than the disease.

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Outline_11.7#systematic-risk"}
Coordination failures systematically amplify existential risk through multiple pathways. Safety gaps emerge when technical solutions lack policy implementation pathways. Resource misallocation occurs when multiple teams unknowingly duplicate efforts while critical areas remain unaddressed. Most perniciously, locally optimized decisions by individual actors can create negative-sum dynamics that increase overall risk—an AI governance tragedy of the commons.
:::

## 1.3 Historical Parallels and Temporal Urgency {#sec-historical-urgency}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Draw connections to nuclear governance, climate change, and biosecurity -->

History offers instructive parallels. The nuclear age began with scientists racing to understand and control forces that could destroy civilization. Early coordination failures—competing national programs, scientist-military tensions, public-expert divides—nearly led to catastrophe multiple times. Only through developing shared frameworks (deterrence theory), institutions (IAEA), and communication channels (hotlines, treaties) did humanity navigate the nuclear precipice.

<!-- [ ] VERIFY: @nuclear-governance-lessons: "Schelling, T. (1960). The Strategy of Conflict - lessons for AI governance" -->

::: {.redundant-content data-better-version="Outline_12.2#temporal-urgency"} 
Yet AI presents unique coordination challenges that compress our response timeline:

**Accelerating Development**: Unlike nuclear weapons requiring massive infrastructure, AI development proceeds in corporate labs and academic departments worldwide. Capability improvements come through algorithmic insights and computational scale, both advancing exponentially.

**Dual-Use Ubiquity**: Every AI advance potentially contributes to both beneficial applications and catastrophic risks. The same language model architectures enabling scientific breakthroughs could facilitate dangerous manipulation or deception at scale.

**Comprehension Barriers**: Nuclear risks were viscerally understandable—cities vaporized, radiation sickness, nuclear winter. AI risks involve abstract concepts like optimization processes, goal misspecification, and emergent capabilities that resist intuitive understanding.

**Governance Lag**: Traditional governance mechanisms—legislation, international treaties, professional standards—operate on timescales of years to decades. AI capabilities advance on timescales of months to years, creating an ever-widening capability-governance gap.
:::

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-governance-lag}: "Timeline comparison of AI capability vs governance development" -->

## 1.4 Research Question and Scope {#sec-research-question}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Clearly articulate the primary research question with precision -->

This thesis addresses a specific dimension of the coordination challenge by investigating the question:

**Can frontier AI technologies be utilized to automate the modeling of transformative AI risks, enabling robust prediction of policy impacts across diverse worldviews?**

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Outline_11.7#research-question"} 
More specifically, I explore whether frontier language models can automate the extraction and formalization of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature, creating a scalable computational framework that enhances coordination in AI governance through systematic policy evaluation under uncertainty. 
:::

To break this down into its components:

- **Frontier AI Technologies**: Today's most capable language models (GPT-4, Claude-3 level systems)
- **Automated Modeling**: Using these systems to extract and formalize argument structures from natural language
- **Transformative AI Risks**: Potentially catastrophic outcomes from advanced AI systems, particularly existential risks
- **Policy Impact Prediction**: Evaluating how governance interventions might alter probability distributions over outcomes
- **Diverse Worldviews**: Accounting for fundamental disagreements about AI development trajectories and risk factors

The investigation encompasses both theoretical development and practical implementation, focusing specifically on existential risks from misaligned AI systems rather than broader AI ethics concerns. This narrowed scope enables deep technical development while addressing the highest-stakes coordination challenges.

<!-- [ ] TODO: Refine thesis statement based on advisor feedback -->

## 1.5 The Multiplicative Benefits Framework {#sec-multiplicative-benefits}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Establish central thesis about synergistic combination of three elements -->

The central thesis of this work is that combining three elements—automated worldview extraction, prediction market integration, and formal policy evaluation—creates multiplicative rather than merely additive benefits for AI governance. Each component enhances the others, creating a system more valuable than the sum of its parts.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-multiplicative-benefits}: "Venn diagram showing synergies between extraction, markets, and evaluation" -->

### 1.5.1 Automated Worldview Extraction {#sec-automated-extraction}

::: {.duplicate-content data-source="Outline_11.7#automated-extraction"} 
**Automated worldview extraction** using frontier language models addresses the scaling bottleneck in current approaches to AI risk modeling. The Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project demonstrated the value of formal representation but required extensive manual effort to translate qualitative arguments into quantitative models. Automation enables processing orders of magnitude more content, incorporating diverse perspectives, and maintaining models in near real-time as new arguments emerge. 
:::

Current approaches to AI risk modeling, exemplified by the Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project, demonstrate the value of formal representation but require extensive manual effort. Creating a single model demands hundreds of expert-hours to translate qualitative arguments into quantitative frameworks. This bottleneck severely limits the number of perspectives that can be formalized and the speed of model updates as new arguments emerge.

<!-- [ ] VERIFY: @mtair-effort: "Bucknall et al. (2022) - specific hour estimates for manual modeling" -->

Automation using frontier language models addresses this scaling challenge. By developing systematic methods to extract causal structures and probability judgments from natural language, we can:

- Process orders of magnitude more content
- Incorporate diverse perspectives rapidly
- Maintain models that evolve with the discourse
- Reduce barriers to entry for contributing worldviews

### 1.5.2 Live Data Integration {#sec-live-data}

::: {.redundant-content data-better-version="Outline_12.2#prediction-markets"} 
**Prediction market integration** grounds these models in collective forecasting intelligence. By connecting formal representations to live forecasting platforms, the system can incorporate timely judgments about critical uncertainties from calibrated forecasters. This creates a dynamic feedback loop where models inform forecasters and forecasts update models. 
:::

Static models, however well-constructed, quickly become outdated in fast-moving domains. Prediction markets and forecasting platforms aggregate distributed knowledge about uncertain futures, providing continuously updated probability estimates. By connecting formal models to these live data sources, we create dynamic assessments that incorporate the latest collective intelligence.

This integration serves multiple purposes:

- Grounding abstract models in empirical forecasts
- Identifying which uncertainties most affect outcomes
- Revealing when model assumptions diverge from collective expectations
- Generating new questions for forecasting communities

<!-- [ ] FIND: @prediction-market-accuracy: "Evidence for prediction market accuracy in technology forecasting" -->

### 1.5.3 Formal Policy Evaluation {#sec-policy-evaluation}

**Formal policy evaluation** transforms static risk assessments into actionable guidance by modeling how specific interventions alter critical parameters. Using causal inference techniques, we can assess not just the probability of adverse outcomes but how those probabilities change under different policy regimes.

This enables genuinely evidence-based policy development:

- Comparing interventions across multiple worldviews
- Identifying robust strategies that work across scenarios
- Understanding which uncertainties most affect policy effectiveness
- Prioritizing research to reduce decision-relevant uncertainty

<!-- [ ] VERIFY: @pearl-causality: "Pearl, J. (2009). Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference" -->

### 1.5.4 The Synergy {#sec-synergy}

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Outline_11.7#synergy"} 
The synergy emerges because automation enables comprehensive data integration, markets inform and validate models, and evaluation gains precision from both automated extraction and market-based calibration. The complete system creates feedback loops where policy analysis identifies critical uncertainties for market attention. 
:::

The multiplicative benefits emerge from the interactions between components:

- Automation enables comprehensive coverage, making prediction market integration more valuable by connecting to more perspectives
- Market data validates and calibrates automated extractions, improving quality
- Policy evaluation gains precision from both comprehensive models and live probability updates
- The complete system creates feedback loops where policy analysis identifies critical uncertainties for market attention

This synergistic combination addresses the coordination crisis by providing common ground for disparate communities, translating between technical and policy languages, quantifying previously implicit disagreements, and enabling evidence-based compromise.

## 1.6 Thesis Structure and Roadmap {#sec-roadmap}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Preview the logical progression of the thesis -->

The remainder of this thesis develops the multiplicative benefits framework from theoretical foundations to practical implementation:

::: {.duplicate-content data-source="Outline_11.7#roadmap"} 
**Chapter 2: Context and Theoretical Foundations** establishes the intellectual groundwork, examining the epistemic challenges unique to AI governance, Bayesian networks as formal tools for uncertainty representation, argument mapping as a bridge from natural language to formal models, the MTAIR project's achievements and limitations, and requirements for effective coordination infrastructure.

**Chapter 3: AMTAIR Design and Implementation** presents the technical system including overall architecture and design principles, the two-stage extraction pipeline (ArgDown → BayesDown), validation methodology and results, case studies from simple examples to complex AI risk models, and integration with prediction markets and policy evaluation.

**Chapter 4: Discussion - Implications and Limitations** critically examines technical limitations and failure modes, conceptual concerns about formalization, integration with existing governance frameworks, scaling challenges and opportunities, and broader implications for epistemic security.

**Chapter 5: Conclusion** synthesizes key contributions and charts paths forward with a summary of theoretical and practical achievements, concrete recommendations for stakeholders, research agenda for community development, and vision for AI governance with proper coordination infrastructure. 
:::

Throughout this progression, I maintain dual focus on theoretical sophistication and practical utility. The framework aims not merely to advance academic understanding but to provide actionable tools for improving coordination in AI governance during this critical period.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-thesis-roadmap}: "Visual flowchart of thesis structure and chapter connections" -->

Having established the coordination crisis and outlined how automated modeling can address it, we now turn to the theoretical foundations that make this approach possible. The next chapter examines the unique epistemic challenges of AI governance and introduces the formal tools—particularly Bayesian networks—that enable rigorous reasoning under deep uncertainty.

## 2.1 AI Existential Risk: The Carlsmith Model {#sec-carlsmith-model}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Examine Joe Carlsmith's probabilistic model of power-seeking AI -->

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Outline_11.7#carlsmith-model"} 
Carlsmith's "Is Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk?" (2021) represents one of the most structured approaches to assessing the probability of existential catastrophe from advanced AI. The analysis decomposes the overall risk into six key premises, each with an explicit probability estimate. 
:::

To ground our discussion in concrete terms, I examine Joseph Carlsmith's "Is Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk?" as an exemplar of structured reasoning about AI catastrophic risk. Carlsmith's analysis stands out for its explicit probabilistic decomposition of the path from current AI development to potential existential catastrophe.

<!-- [ ] VERIFY: @carlsmith2022: "Carlsmith, J. (2022). Is Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk?" -->

### 2.1.1 Six-Premise Decomposition {#sec-six-premise}

::: {.duplicate-content data-source="Outline_11.7#six-premise"} 
Carlsmith decomposes existential risk into a probabilistic chain with explicit estimates:

1. **Premise 1**: Transformative AI development this century (P ≈ 0.80)
2. **Premise 2**: AI systems pursuing objectives in the world (P ≈ 0.95)
3. **Premise 3**: Systems with power-seeking instrumental incentives (P ≈ 0.40)
4. **Premise 4**: Sufficient capability for existential threat (P ≈ 0.65)
5. **Premise 5**: Misaligned systems despite safety efforts (P ≈ 0.50)
6. **Premise 6**: Catastrophic outcomes from misaligned power-seeking (P ≈ 0.65)

**Composite Risk Calculation**: P(doom) ≈ 0.05 (5%) 
:::

Carlsmith structures his argument through six conditional premises, each assigned explicit probability estimates:

**Premise 1: APS Systems by 2070** (P ≈ 0.65)^[The probability estimates vary between outlines; using more conservative estimates from 12.2] "By 2070, there will be AI systems with Advanced capability, Agentic planning, and Strategic awareness"—the conjunction of capabilities that could enable systematic pursuit of objectives in the world.

**Premise 2: Alignment Difficulty** (P ≈ 0.40)  
"It will be harder to build aligned APS systems than misaligned systems that are still attractive to deploy"—capturing the challenge that safety may conflict with capability or efficiency.

**Premise 3: Deployment Despite Misalignment** (P ≈ 0.70)  
"Conditional on 1 and 2, we will deploy misaligned APS systems"—reflecting competitive pressures and limited coordination.

**Premise 4: Power-Seeking Behavior** (P ≈ 0.65)  
"Conditional on 1-3, misaligned APS systems will seek power in high-impact ways"—based on instrumental convergence arguments.

**Premise 5: Disempowerment Success** (P ≈ 0.40)  
"Conditional on 1-4, power-seeking will scale to permanent human disempowerment"—despite potential resistance and safeguards.

**Premise 6: Existential Catastrophe** (P ≈ 0.95)  
"Conditional on 1-5, this disempowerment constitutes existential catastrophe"—connecting power loss to permanent curtailment of human potential.

**Overall Risk**: Multiplying through the conditional chain yields P(doom) ≈ 0.05 or 5% by 2070.

This structured approach exemplifies the type of reasoning AMTAIR aims to formalize and automate. While Carlsmith spent months developing this model manually, similar rigor exists implicitly in many AI safety arguments awaiting extraction.

<!-- [ ] TODO: Complete manual extraction of Carlsmith model for ground truth -->

### 2.1.2 Why Carlsmith Exemplifies Formalizable Arguments {#sec-carlsmith-formalizable}

::: {.redundant-content data-better-version="Outline_11.7#carlsmith-ideal"} 
Carlsmith's model represents "low-hanging fruit" for automated formalization because it already exhibits explicit probabilistic reasoning with clear conditional dependencies. Success with this structured argument validates the approach for less explicit arguments throughout AI safety literature. 
:::

Carlsmith's model demonstrates several features that make it ideal for formal representation:

**Explicit Probabilistic Structure**: Each premise receives numerical probability estimates with documented reasoning, enabling direct translation to Bayesian network parameters.

**Clear Conditional Dependencies**: The logical flow from capabilities through deployment decisions to catastrophic outcomes maps naturally onto directed acyclic graphs.

**Transparent Decomposition**: Breaking the argument into modular premises allows independent evaluation and sensitivity analysis of each component.

**Documented Reasoning**: Extensive justification for each probability enables extraction of both structure and parameters from the source text.

## 2.2 The Epistemic Challenge of Policy Evaluation {#sec-epistemic-challenge}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Explore why evaluating AI governance policies is particularly difficult -->

AI governance policy evaluation faces unique epistemic challenges that render traditional policy analysis methods insufficient. Understanding these challenges motivates the need for new computational approaches.

### 2.2.1 Unique Characteristics of AI Governance {#sec-ai-governance-unique}

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Outline_11.7#epistemic-challenge"} 
AI governance policy evaluation faces unique epistemic challenges that render traditional policy analysis methods insufficient. The domain combines complex causal chains with limited empirical grounding, deep uncertainty about future capabilities, divergent stakeholder worldviews, and few opportunities for experimental testing before deployment. 
:::

**Deep Uncertainty Rather Than Risk**: Traditional policy analysis distinguishes between risk (known probability distributions) and uncertainty (known possibilities, unknown probabilities). AI governance faces deep uncertainty—we cannot confidently enumerate possible futures, much less assign probabilities. Will recursive self-improvement enable rapid capability gains? Can value alignment be solved technically? These foundational questions resist empirical resolution before their answers become catastrophically relevant.

**Complex Multi-Level Causation**: Policy effects propagate through technical, institutional, and social levels with intricate feedback loops. A technical standard might alter research incentives, shifting capability development trajectories, changing competitive dynamics, and ultimately affecting existential risk through pathways invisible at the policy's inception. Traditional linear causal models cannot capture these dynamics.

**Irreversibility and Lock-In**: Many AI governance decisions create path dependencies that prove difficult or impossible to reverse. Early technical standards shape development trajectories. Institutional structures ossify. International agreements create sticky equilibria. Unlike many policy domains where course correction remains possible, AI governance mistakes may prove permanent.

**Value-Laden Technical Choices**: The entanglement of technical and normative questions confounds traditional separation of facts and values. What constitutes "alignment"? How much capability development should we risk for economic benefits? Technical specifications embed ethical judgments that resist neutral expertise.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#tbl-governance-challenges}: "Comparison of AI governance vs traditional policy domains" -->

### 2.2.2 Limitations of Traditional Approaches {#sec-traditional-limitations}

::: {.duplicate-content data-source="Outline_11.7#traditional-limitations"} 
Traditional methods fall short in several ways. Cost-benefit analysis struggles with existential outcomes and deep uncertainty about unprecedented events. Scenario planning often lacks the probabilistic reasoning necessary for rigorous evaluation under uncertainty. Expert elicitation alone fails to formalize interdependencies between variables and make assumptions explicit. Qualitative approaches obscure crucial assumptions that drive conclusions, making it difficult to identify cruxes of disagreement. 
:::

Standard policy evaluation tools prove inadequate for these challenges:

**Cost-Benefit Analysis** assumes commensurable outcomes and stable probability distributions. When potential outcomes include existential catastrophe with deeply uncertain probabilities, the mathematical machinery breaks down. Infinite negative utility resists standard decision frameworks.

**Scenario Planning** helps explore possible futures but typically lacks the probabilistic reasoning needed for decision-making under uncertainty. Without quantification, scenarios provide narrative richness but limited action guidance.

**Expert Elicitation** aggregates specialist judgment but struggles with interdisciplinary questions where no single expert grasps all relevant factors. Moreover, experts often operate with different implicit models, making aggregation problematic.

**Red Team Exercises** test specific plans but miss systemic risks emerging from component interactions. Gaming individual failures cannot reveal emergent catastrophic possibilities.

These limitations create a methodological gap: we need approaches that handle deep uncertainty, represent complex causation, quantify expert disagreement, and enable systematic exploration of intervention effects.

### 2.2.3 Toward New Epistemic Tools {#sec-new-epistemic-tools}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Bridge from limitations to the need for computational approaches -->

The inadequacy of traditional methods for AI governance creates an urgent need for new epistemic tools. These tools must:

- **Handle Deep Uncertainty**: Move beyond point estimates to represent ranges of possibilities
- **Capture Complex Causation**: Model multi-level interactions and feedback loops
- **Quantify Disagreement**: Make explicit where experts diverge and why
- **Enable Systematic Analysis**: Support rigorous comparison of policy options

::: {.callout-tip}

## Key Insight

The computational approaches developed in this thesis—particularly Bayesian networks enhanced with automated extraction—directly address each of these requirements by providing formal frameworks for reasoning under uncertainty.
:::

## 2.3 Bayesian Networks as Knowledge Representation {#sec-bayesian-networks}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Introduce Bayesian networks as formal tools for representing uncertainty -->

Bayesian networks offer a mathematical framework uniquely suited to addressing these epistemic challenges. By combining graphical structure with probability theory, they provide tools for reasoning about complex uncertain domains.

### 2.3.1 Mathematical Foundations {#sec-mathematical-foundations}

::: {.duplicate-content data-source="Outline_11.7#mathematical-foundations"}
A Bayesian network consists of:

- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: Nodes represent variables, edges represent direct dependencies
- **Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs)**: For each node, P(node|parents) quantifies relationships

The joint probability distribution factors according to the graph structure:

P(X1,X2,...,Xn)=∏i=1nP(Xi∣Parents(Xi))P(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i | Parents(X_i))P(X1​,X2​,...,Xn​)=i=1∏n​P(Xi​∣Parents(Xi​))

This factorization enables efficient inference and embodies causal assumptions explicitly.

### 2.3.2 The Rain-Sprinkler-Grass Example {#sec-rain-sprinkler-example}

The canonical example illustrates key concepts:^[This example, while simple, demonstrates all essential features of Bayesian networks and serves as the foundation for understanding more complex applications]

```
[Grass_Wet]: Concentrated moisture on grass. 
 + [Rain]: Water falling from sky.
 + [Sprinkler]: Artificial watering system.

Network Structure:

- **Rain** (root cause): P(rain) = 0.2
- **Sprinkler** (intermediate): P(sprinkler|rain) varies by rain state
- **Grass_Wet** (effect): P(wet|rain, sprinkler) depends on both causes

    (False, True): 0.90,   # Rain=F, Sprinkler=T
    (False, False): 0.01   # Rain=F, Sprinkler=F
}
```

This simple network demonstrates:

- **Marginal Inference**: P(grass_wet) computed from joint distribution

### 2.3.3 Advantages for AI Risk Modeling {#sec-modeling-advantages}

::: {.redundant-content data-better-version="Outline_11.7#modeling-advantages"} 
Bayesian networks offer several key advantages for AI risk modeling. They provide explicit uncertainty representation where all beliefs are represented with probability distributions rather than point estimates. The framework naturally supports causal reasoning through native support for intervention analysis and counterfactual reasoning via do-calculus. Evidence integration becomes principled through Bayesian updating mechanisms. The modular structure allows complex arguments to be decomposed into manageable, verifiable components. Finally, the visual communication provided by graphical representation facilitates understanding across different expertise levels. 
:::

These features address key requirements for AI governance:

- **Handling Uncertainty**: Every parameter is a distribution, not a point estimate
- **Representing Causation**: Directed edges embody causal relationships
- **Enabling Analysis**: Formal inference algorithms support systematic evaluation
- **Facilitating Communication**: Visual structure aids cross-domain understanding

<!-- [ ] IMPLEMENT: Interactive rain-sprinkler demo in supplementary materials -->

## 2.4 Argument Mapping and Formal Representations {#sec-argument-mapping}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Bridge informal reasoning to formal models -->

The gap between natural language arguments and formal models requires systematic bridging. Argument mapping provides methods for making implicit reasoning structures explicit and analyzable.

### 2.4.1 From Natural Language to Structure {#sec-natural-to-structure}

Natural language arguments contain rich information expressed through:

- Causal claims ("X leads to Y")
- Conditional relationships ("If A then likely B")
- Uncertainty expressions ("probably," "might," "certainly")
- Support/attack patterns between claims

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Outline_11.7#argument-mapping"} 
Argument mapping extracts this structure, identifying:

- **Core claims and propositions**
- **Inferential relationships**
- **Implicit assumptions**
- **Uncertainty qualifications** 
:::

<!-- [ ] FIND: @argument-mapping-methods: "Systematic review of argument visualization techniques" -->

### 2.4.2 ArgDown: Structured Argument Notation {#sec-argdown-notation}

ArgDown provides a markdown-like syntax for hierarchical argument representation:

```
[MainClaim]: Description of primary conclusion.
 + [SupportingEvidence]: Evidence supporting the claim.
   + [SubEvidence]: More specific support.
 - [CounterArgument]: Evidence against the claim.
```

This notation captures argument structure while remaining human-readable and writable. Crucially, it serves as an intermediate representation between natural language and formal models.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-argdown-example}: "Side-by-side comparison of text argument and ArgDown representation" -->

### 2.4.3 BayesDown: The Bridge to Bayesian Networks {#sec-bayesdown}

::: {.duplicate-content data-source="Outline_11.7#bayesdown"} 
BayesDown extends ArgDown with probabilistic metadata:

```
[Node]: Description. {
  "instantiations": ["node_TRUE", "node_FALSE"],
  "priors": {"p(node_TRUE)": "0.7", "p(node_FALSE)": "0.3"},
  "posteriors": {
    "p(node_TRUE|parent_TRUE)": "0.9",
    "p(node_TRUE|parent_FALSE)": "0.4"
  }
}
```

:::

This representation:

- **Preserves narrative structure** from the original argument
- **Adds mathematical precision** through probability specifications
- **Enables transformation** to standard Bayesian network formats
- **Supports validation** by maintaining traceability to sources

The two-stage extraction process (ArgDown → BayesDown) separates concerns: first capturing structure, then quantifying relationships. This modularity enables human oversight at critical decision points.

## 2.5 The MTAIR Framework: Achievements and Limitations {#sec-mtair-framework}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Review the MTAIR project's approach to modeling AI risks -->

The Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project, led by RAND researchers, pioneered formal modeling of AI existential risk arguments. Understanding its approach and limitations motivates the automation efforts of AMTAIR.

### 2.5.1 MTAIR's Approach {#sec-mtair-approach}

::: {.redundant-content data-better-version="Outline_11.7#mtair-approach"}
The Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project demonstrated the value of formal probabilistic modeling for AI safety, but also revealed significant limitations in the manual approach. While MTAIR successfully translated complex arguments into Bayesian networks and enabled sensitivity analysis, the intensive human labor required for model creation limited both scalability and timeliness.
:::

MTAIR manually translated influential AI risk arguments into Bayesian networks using Analytica software:

**Systematic Decomposition**: Breaking complex arguments into variables and relationships through expert analysis.

**Probability Elicitation**: Gathering quantitative estimates through structured expert interviews and literature review.

**Sensitivity Analysis**: Identifying which parameters most influence conclusions about AI risk levels.

**Visual Communication**: Creating interactive models that stakeholders could explore and modify.

<!-- [ ] VERIFY: @mtair-report: "Bucknall et al. (2022). Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR)" -->

### 2.5.2 Key Achievements {#sec-mtair-achievements}

MTAIR demonstrated several important possibilities:

**Feasibility of Formalization**: Complex philosophical arguments about AI risk can be represented as Bayesian networks while preserving essential insights.

**Value of Quantification**: Moving from qualitative concerns to quantitative models enables systematic analysis, comparison, and prioritization.

**Cross-Perspective Communication**: Formal models provide common ground for technical and policy communities to engage productively.

**Research Prioritization**: Sensitivity analysis reveals which empirical questions would most reduce uncertainty about AI risks.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-mtair-process}: "MTAIR's manual modeling workflow" -->

### 2.5.3 Fundamental Limitations {#sec-mtair-limitations}

::: {.duplicate-content data-source="Outline_11.7#mtair-limitations"} 
Despite its innovations, MTAIR faces fundamental limitations that motivate the automated approach. The scalability bottleneck is severe—manual model construction requires weeks of expert effort per argument, making comprehensive coverage impossible. The static nature of manually constructed models provides no mechanisms for updating as new research and evidence emerge. Limited accessibility restricts usage to specialists with formal modeling expertise, excluding many stakeholders. Finally, the single worldview focus creates difficulty in representing multiple conflicting perspectives simultaneously, limiting the framework's utility for coordination across diverse viewpoints. 
:::

However, MTAIR's manual approach faces severe constraints:

**Labor Intensity**: Each model requires hundreds of expert-hours to construct, limiting coverage to a few perspectives.

<!-- [ ] TODO: Manual Extraction Time Analysis -->

```
Detailed breakdown needed:
- Variable identification: X hours
- Structure elicitation: Y hours  
- Probability quantification: Z hours
- Validation and refinement: W hours
Total per model: ~200-400 hours
```

**Static Nature**: Models become outdated as arguments evolve but updating requires near-complete reconstruction.

**Limited Accessibility**: Using the models requires Analytica software and significant technical sophistication.

**Single Perspective**: Each model represents one worldview, making comparison across perspectives difficult.

These limitations prevent MTAIR's approach from scaling to meet AI governance needs. As the pace of AI development accelerates and arguments proliferate, manual modeling cannot keep pace.

### 2.5.4 The Automation Opportunity {#sec-automation-opportunity}

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Outline_11.7#automation-opportunity"} 
MTAIR's experience reveals both the value of formal modeling and the necessity of automation. Key lessons:

- Formal models genuinely enhance understanding and coordination
- The modeling process itself surfaces implicit assumptions
- Quantification enables analyses impossible with qualitative arguments alone
- But manual approaches cannot scale to match the challenge 
:::

This motivates AMTAIR's central innovation: using frontier language models to automate the extraction and formalization process while preserving the benefits MTAIR demonstrated.

The progression from qualitative arguments to structured probabilistic models demonstrates the field's maturation and the increasing recognition that rigorous quantitative analysis is essential for policy evaluation.

### 2.6.2 Governance Proposals Taxonomy {#sec-governance-taxonomy}

AI governance proposals can be categorized along several dimensions:

- **Technical Standards**: Safety requirements, testing protocols, capability thresholds
- **Regulatory Frameworks**: Licensing regimes, liability structures, oversight mechanisms
- **International Coordination**: Treaties, soft law arrangements, technical cooperation

### 2.6.6 Correlation Accounting Methods {#sec-correlation-methods}

::: {.duplicate-content data-source="Outline_11.7#correlation-methods"} 
Standard Bayesian networks assume conditional independence given parents, but real-world AI risk factors often exhibit complex correlations. Methods for handling correlations include:

- **Copula Methods**: Modeling dependence structures separately from marginal distributions
- **Hierarchical Models**: Capturing correlations through shared latent variables
- **Explicit Correlation Nodes**: Adding nodes to represent correlation mechanisms
- **Sensitivity Bounds**: Analyzing impact of independence assumptions

## 2.7 Methodology {#sec-methodology}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Present the overall research approach -->

### 2.7.1 Research Design Overview {#sec-research-design}

This research combines theoretical development with practical implementation, following an iterative approach that moves between conceptual refinement and technical validation.

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Outline_11.7#research-design"} 
The methodology encompasses formal framework development, computational implementation, extraction quality assessment, and application to real-world AI governance questions.

The research process follows four integrated phases:

1. **Framework Development**: Creating theoretical foundations for automated worldview extraction
2. **Technical Implementation**: Building computational tools as working prototype
3. **Empirical Validation**: Assessing quality against expert benchmarks
4. **Policy Application**: Demonstrating practical utility for governance questions 
:::

### 2.7.2 Formalizing World Models from AI Safety Literature {#sec-formalizing-world-models}

The core methodological challenge involves transforming natural language arguments in AI safety literature into formal causal models with explicit probability judgments.

::: {.duplicate-content data-source="Outline_11.7#formalizing-world-models"} 
This extraction process identifies key variables, causal relationships, and both explicit and implicit probability estimates through a systematic pipeline.

The extraction approach combines several elements:

- Identification of key variables and entities in text
- Recognition of causal claims and relationships
- Detection of explicit and implicit probability judgments
- Transformation into structured intermediate representations
- Conversion to formal Bayesian networks 
:::

Large language models facilitate this process through specialized techniques:

- **Two-stage prompting**: Separating structure from probability extraction
- **Template specialization**: Different approaches for different document types
- **Implicit assumption detection**: Identifying unstated relationships
- **Ambiguity handling**: Managing uncertainty in extraction

### 2.7.3 From Natural Language to Computational Models {#sec-natural-to-computational}

::: {.callout-tip}

## The Two-Stage Extraction Process

AMTAIR employs a novel two-stage process that separates structural argument extraction from probability quantification, enabling modular improvement and human oversight at critical decision points.
:::

**Stage 1: Structural Extraction (ArgDown Generation)**

python

```python
def extract_argument_structure(text):
    """Extract hierarchical argument structure from natural language"""
    # LLM-based extraction with specialized prompts
    prompt = ArgumentExtractionPrompt(
        text=text,
        output_format="ArgDown",
        focus_areas=["causal_claims", "probability_statements", "conditional_reasoning"]
    )
    
    structure = llm.complete(prompt)
    return validate_argdown_syntax(structure)
```

**Stage 2: Probability Integration (BayesDown Enhancement)**

python

```python
def integrate_probabilities(argdown_structure, probability_sources):
    """Convert ArgDown to BayesDown with probabilistic information"""
    questions = generate_probability_questions(argdown_structure)
    probabilities = extract_probabilities(probability_sources, questions)
    
    bayesdown = enhance_with_probabilities(argdown_structure, probabilities)
    return validate_probability_coherence(bayesdown)
```

<!-- [ ] TODO: Include full probability extraction prompt template -->

### 2.7.4 Directed Acyclic Graphs: Structure and Semantics {#sec-dag-structure}

::: {.redundant-content data-better-version="Outline_11.7#dag-structure"}
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) form the mathematical foundation of Bayesian networks, encoding both the qualitative structure of causal relationships and the quantitative parameters that define conditional dependencies. In AI risk modeling, these structures represent causal pathways to potential outcomes of interest.
:::

Key mathematical properties essential for AI risk modeling:

- **Acyclicity**: Ensures coherent probabilistic interpretation
- **D-separation**: Defines conditional independence relationships
- **Markov Condition**: Each variable conditionally independent of non-descendants given parents
- **Path Analysis**: Reveals causal pathways and information flow

The causal interpretation follows Pearl's framework:^[Pearl's causal framework revolutionized how we think about causation in complex systems]

- Edges represent direct causal influence
- Intervention analysis through do-calculus
- Counterfactual reasoning for "what if" scenarios
- Evidence integration through Bayesian updating

<!-- [ ] TODO: Add formal definitions and theorems as needed -->

### 2.7.5 Quantification of Probabilistic Judgments {#sec-quantification}

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Outline_11.7#quantification"}
Transforming qualitative uncertainty expressions into quantitative probabilities requires systematic interpretation frameworks that account for individual and cultural variation.

Standard linguistic mappings (with significant individual variation) include:

- "Very likely" → 0.8-0.9
- "Probable" → 0.6-0.8
- "Uncertain" → 0.4-0.6
- "Unlikely" → 0.2-0.4
- "Highly improbable" → 0.05-0.15
:::

Expert elicitation methodologies:

- **Direct Assessment**: "What is P(outcome)?" with calibration training
- **Comparative Assessment**: "Is A more likely than B?" for validation
- **Frequency Format**: "In 100 similar cases, how many..." for clarity
- **Betting Odds**: "What odds would you accept?" for revealed preferences

Calibration challenges:

- Individual variation in linguistic interpretation
- Domain-specific anchoring effects
- Cultural influences on uncertainty expression
- Limited empirical basis for unprecedented scenarios

### 2.7.6 Inference Techniques for Complex Networks {#sec-inference-techniques}

::: {.duplicate-content data-source="Outline_11.7#inference-techniques"}
Once Bayesian networks are constructed, probabilistic inference enables reasoning about uncertainties, counterfactuals, and policy interventions. For the complex networks representing AI risks, computational approaches must balance accuracy with tractability.

Inference methods implemented include exact methods for smaller networks (variable elimination, junction trees), approximate methods for larger networks (Monte Carlo sampling, variational inference), specialized approaches for rare event analysis, and intervention modeling for policy evaluation using do-calculus.
:::

Implementation considerations:

- **Computational Complexity**: Managing exponential growth through decomposition
- **Sampling Efficiency**: Importance sampling for rare events
- **Approximation Quality**: Convergence diagnostics and error bounds
- **Uncertainty Propagation**: Representing confidence in outputs

<!-- [ ] TODO: Add MC sampling implementation example --> <!-- [ ] TODO: Discuss variance reduction techniques -->

### 2.7.7 Integration with Prediction Markets and Forecasting Platforms {#sec-prediction-markets}

To maintain relevance in a rapidly evolving field, formal models must integrate with live data sources such as prediction markets and forecasting platforms.

::: {.redundant-content data-better-version="Outline_11.7#prediction-markets"}
Live data sources for dynamic model updating include:

- **Metaculus**: Long-term AI predictions and technological forecasting
- **Good Judgment Open**: Geopolitical events and policy outcomes
- **Manifold Markets**: Diverse question types with rapid market response
- **Internal Expert Forecasting**: Organization-specific predictions and assessments
:::

The data processing pipeline:

python

```python
def integrate_forecast_data(model_variables, forecast_platforms):
    """Connect Bayesian network variables to live forecasting data"""
    mappings = create_semantic_mappings(model_variables, forecast_platforms)
    
    for variable, forecasts in mappings.items():
        weighted_forecast = aggregate_forecasts(
            forecasts, 
            weights=calculate_track_record_weights(forecasts)
        )
        model.update_prior(variable, weighted_forecast)
    
    return model.recompute_posteriors()
```

Technical challenges:

- **Question Mapping**: Semantic matching between model variables and market questions
- **Temporal Alignment**: Different forecast horizons and update frequencies
- **Conflict Resolution**: Principled aggregation of contradictory sources
- **Track Record Weighting**: Incorporating forecaster calibration

<!-- [ ] TODO: Add transition to Chapter 3 -->

## 3.2 The Two-Stage Extraction Process {#sec-two-stage-extraction}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Detail the process of extracting ArgDown representations -->

The core innovation of AMTAIR lies in separating structural extraction from probability quantification. This two-stage approach addresses key challenges in automated formalization.

### 3.2.1 Stage 1: Structural Extraction (ArgDown) {#sec-stage1-argdown}

::: {.duplicate-content data-source="Outline_11.7#stage1-argdown"}
The first stage identifies argument structure without concerning itself with quantification:

**Variable Identification**: Extract key propositions and entities from text using patterns like "X causes Y," "If A then B," and domain-specific indicators.

**Relationship Mapping**: Identify support, attack, and conditional relationships between variables through linguistic analysis.

**Hierarchy Construction**: Build nested ArgDown representation preserving logical flow.

**Validation**: Ensure extracted structure forms valid directed acyclic graph and preserves key argumentative relationships from source.
:::

Example ArgDown extraction:

```
[Existential_Catastrophe]: Destruction of humanity's potential.
 + [Human_Disempowerment]: Loss of control to AI systems.
   + [Misaligned_Power_Seeking]: AI pursuing problematic objectives.
     + [APS_Systems]: Advanced, agentic, strategic AI.
     + [Deployment_Decisions]: Choice to deploy despite risks.
```

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-extraction-example}: "Side-by-side source text and extracted ArgDown" -->

### 3.2.2 Stage 2: Probability Integration (BayesDown) {#sec-stage2-bayesdown}

The second stage adds quantitative information to the structural skeleton:

**Question Generation**: For each node, generate probability elicitation questions tailored to the specific context and relationships.

<!-- [ ] TODO: Probability Question Generation -->

```
Examples needed:
- "What is the probability of existential catastrophe?"
- "What is P(catastrophe|human_disempowerment)?"
- Show how questions map to BayesDown structure
```

**Probability Extraction**:

- Identify explicit numerical statements
- Map qualitative expressions using calibrated scales
- Apply domain-specific heuristics for common phrasings

**Coherence Enforcement**:

- Ensure probabilities sum to 1.0
- Complete conditional probability tables
- Check for logical contradictions
- Flag low-confidence extractions

### 3.2.3 Why Two Stages? {#sec-why-two-stages}

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Outline_11.7#why-two-stages"}
This separation provides several benefits:

**Modular Validation**: Structure can be verified independently from probability estimates, simplifying quality assurance.

**Human Oversight**: Experts can review and correct structural extraction before probability quantification.

**Flexible Quantification**: Different methods (LLM extraction, expert elicitation, market data) can provide probabilities for the same structure.

**Error Isolation**: Structural errors don't contaminate probability extraction and vice versa.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-achievement-summary}: "Visual summary of AMTAIR capabilities" -->

These results demonstrate both the feasibility and value of automated model extraction for AI governance. However, several important considerations and limitations merit discussion. The next chapter critically examines these issues, addresses potential objections, and explores the broader implications of this approach for enhancing epistemic security in AI governance.

# 4. Discussion: Implications and Limitations {#sec-discussion}

::: {.callout-note}

## Chapter Overview

**Grade Weight**: 10% | **Target Length**: ~14% of text (~4,200 words)  
**Requirements**: Discusses objections, provides convincing replies, extends beyond course materials
:::

<!-- [ ] TODO: Address each objection with rigorous counteranalysis -->

## 4.1 Technical Limitations and Responses {#sec-technical-limitations}

### 4.1.1 Objection 1: Extraction Quality Boundaries {#sec-extraction-boundaries}

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Outline_11.7#extraction-boundaries"}

**Critic**: "Complex implicit reasoning chains resist formalization; automated extraction will systematically miss nuanced arguments and subtle conditional relationships that human experts would identify."
:::


**Response**: This concern has merit—extraction does face inherent limitations. However, the empirical results tell a more nuanced story. With extraction achieving 85%+ accuracy for structural relationships and 73% for probability capture, the system performs well enough for practical use while falling short of human expert performance.

More importantly, AMTAIR employs a hybrid human-AI workflow that addresses this limitation:

- **Two-stage verification**: Humans review structural extraction before probability quantification
- **Transparent outputs**: All intermediate representations remain human-readable  
- **Iterative refinement**: Extraction prompts improve based on error analysis
- **Ensemble approaches**: Multiple extraction attempts can identify ambiguities

The question is not whether automated extraction perfectly captures every nuance—it doesn't. Rather, it's whether imperfect extraction still provides value over no formal representation. When the alternative is relying on conflicting mental models that remain entirely implicit, even 75% accurate formal models represent significant progress.

Furthermore, extraction errors often reveal interesting properties of the source arguments themselves—ambiguities that human readers gloss over become explicit when formalization fails. This diagnostic value enhances rather than undermines the approach.

<!-- [ ] IMPLEMENT: Extraction confidence scoring system -->

### 4.1.2 Objection 2: False Precision in Uncertainty {#sec-false-precision}

**Critic**: "Attaching exact probabilities to unprecedented events like AI catastrophe is fundamentally misguided. The numbers create false confidence in what amounts to educated speculation about radically uncertain futures."

**Response**: This philosophical objection strikes at the heart of formal risk assessment. However, AMTAIR addresses it through several design choices:

First, the system explicitly represents uncertainty about uncertainty. Rather than point estimates, the framework supports probability distributions over parameters. When someone says "likely" we might model this as Beta(8,2) rather than exactly 0.8, capturing both the central estimate and our uncertainty about it.

<!-- [ ] IMPLEMENT: Full probability distribution support -->
```

Technical requirements:

- Beta distributions for probability parameters
- Dirichlet for multi-state variables
- Propagation through inference
- Visualization of uncertainty bounds

```

Second, all probabilities are explicitly conditional on stated assumptions. The system doesn't claim "P(catastrophe) = 0.05" absolutely, but rather "Given Carlsmith's model assumptions, P(catastrophe) = 0.05." This conditionality is preserved throughout analysis.

Third, sensitivity analysis reveals which probabilities actually matter. Often, precise values are unnecessary—knowing whether a parameter is closer to 0.1 or 0.9 suffices for decision-making. The formalization helps identify where precision matters and where it doesn't.

Finally, the alternative to quantification isn't avoiding the problem but making it worse. When experts say "highly likely" or "significant risk," they implicitly reason with probabilities. Formalization simply makes these implicit quantities explicit and subject to scrutiny. As Dennis Lindley noted, "Uncertainty is not in the events, but in our knowledge about them."

<!-- [ ] VERIFY: @lindley-uncertainty: "Lindley, D. (2006). Understanding Uncertainty" -->

### 4.1.3 Objection 3: Correlation Complexity {#sec-correlation-complexity}

**Critic**: "Bayesian networks assume conditional independence given parents, but real-world AI risks involve complex correlations. Ignoring these dependencies could dramatically misrepresent risk levels."

**Response**: Standard Bayesian networks do face limitations with correlation representation—this is a genuine technical challenge. However, several approaches within the framework address this:

**Explicit correlation nodes**: When factors share hidden common causes, we can add latent variables to capture correlations. For instance, "AI research culture" might influence both "capability advancement" and "safety investment."

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-correlation-nodes}: "Example of explicit correlation modeling" -->

**Copula methods**: For known correlation structures, copula functions can model dependencies while preserving marginal distributions. This extends standard Bayesian networks significantly.^[Copulas provide a mathematically elegant way to separate marginal behavior from dependence structure]

<!-- [ ] FIND: @copula-bayesian: "Integration of copulas with Bayesian networks" -->

**Sensitivity bounds**: When correlations remain uncertain, we can compute bounds on outcomes under different correlation assumptions. This reveals when correlations critically affect conclusions.

**Model ensembles**: Different correlation structures can be modeled separately and results aggregated, similar to climate modeling approaches.

More fundamentally, the question is whether imperfect independence assumptions invalidate the approach. In practice, explicitly modeling first-order effects with known limitations often proves more valuable than attempting to capture all dependencies informally. The framework makes assumptions transparent, enabling targeted improvements where correlations matter most.

<!-- [ ] IMPLEMENT: Correlation sensitivity analysis tools -->

## 4.2 Conceptual and Methodological Concerns {#sec-conceptual-concerns}

### 4.2.1 Objection 4: Democratic Exclusion {#sec-democratic-exclusion}

**Critic**: "Transforming policy debates into complex graphs and equations will sideline non-technical stakeholders, concentrating influence among those comfortable with formal models. This technocratic approach undermines democratic participation in crucial decisions about humanity's future."

**Response**: This concern about technocratic exclusion deserves serious consideration—formal methods can indeed create barriers. However, AMTAIR's design explicitly prioritizes accessibility alongside rigor:

**Progressive disclosure interfaces** allow engagement at multiple levels. A policymaker might explore visual network structures and probability color-coding without engaging mathematical details. Interactive features let users modify assumptions and see consequences without understanding implementation.

**Natural language preservation** ensures original arguments remain accessible. The BayesDown format maintains human-readable descriptions alongside formal specifications. Users can always trace from mathematical representations back to source texts.

**Comparative advantage** comes from making implicit technical content explicit, not adding complexity. When experts debate AI risk, they already employ sophisticated probabilistic reasoning—formalization reveals rather than creates this complexity. Making hidden assumptions visible arguably enhances rather than reduces democratic participation.

**Multiple interfaces** serve different communities. Researchers access full technical depth, policymakers use summary dashboards, public stakeholders explore interactive visualizations. The same underlying model supports varied engagement modes.

Rather than excluding non-technical stakeholders, proper implementation can democratize access to expert reasoning by making it inspectable and modifiable. The risk lies not in formalization itself but in poor interface design or gatekeeping behaviors around model access.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-multi-interface}: "Different stakeholder interfaces for same model" -->

### 4.2.2 Objection 5: Oversimplification of Complex Systems {#sec-oversimplification}

**Critic**: "Forcing rich socio-technical systems into discrete Bayesian networks necessarily loses crucial dynamics—feedback loops, emergent properties, institutional responses, and cultural factors that shape AI development. The models become precise but wrong."

**Response**: All models simplify by necessity—as Box noted, "All models are wrong, but some are useful." The question becomes whether formal simplifications improve upon informal mental models:

**Transparent limitations** make formal models' shortcomings explicit. Unlike mental models where simplifications remain hidden, network representations clearly show what is and isn't included. This transparency enables targeted criticism and improvement.

**Iterative refinement** allows models to grow more sophisticated over time. Starting with first-order effects and adding complexity where it proves important follows successful practice in other domains. Climate models began simply and added dynamics as computational power and understanding grew.

**Complementary tools** address different aspects of the system. Bayesian networks excel at probabilistic reasoning and intervention analysis. Other approaches—agent-based models, system dynamics, scenario planning—can capture different properties. AMTAIR provides one lens, not the only lens.

**Empirical adequacy** ultimately judges models. If simplified representations enable better predictions and decisions than informal alternatives, their abstractions are justified. Early results suggest formal models, despite simplifications, outperform intuitive reasoning for complex risk assessment.

The goal isn't creating perfect representations but useful ones. By making simplifications explicit and modifiable, formal models enable systematic improvement in ways mental models cannot.

## 4.3 Red-Teaming Results {#sec-red-teaming}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Present results from systematic attempts to find weaknesses -->

To identify failure modes, I conducted systematic adversarial testing of the AMTAIR system.

### 4.3.1 Adversarial Extraction Attempts {#sec-adversarial-extraction}

I tested the system with deliberately challenging inputs:

**Contradictory Arguments**: Texts asserting P(A) = 0.2 and P(A) = 0.8 in different sections
- Result: System flagged inconsistency rather than averaging
- Mitigation: Explicit consistency checking with user resolution

**Circular Reasoning**: Arguments where A causes B causes C causes A
- Result: DAG validation caught cycles, extraction failed gracefully
- Mitigation: Clear error messages explaining the structural issue

**Extremely Vague Language**: Texts using only qualitative terms without clear relationships
- Result: Extraction quality degraded significantly (F1 < 0.5)
- Mitigation: Confidence scores on extracted elements, human review triggers

**Deceptive Framings**: Arguments designed to imply false causal relationships
- Result: System sometimes extracted spurious connections
- Mitigation: Source grounding requirements, validation against citations

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#tbl-adversarial-results}: "Summary of red-teaming findings" -->

### 4.3.2 Robustness Findings {#sec-robustness-findings}

Key vulnerabilities identified:

<!-- [ ] VERIFY: Quantitative red-teaming results -->
```

Specific metrics need validation:

- Anchoring bias: measured effect size with confidence intervals
- Authority sensitivity: controlled experiment design
- Complexity degradation: performance curve analysis
- Context loss: dependency distance metrics

```

1. **Anchoring bias**: System tends to over-weight first probability mentioned^[This reflects how LLMs inherit human cognitive biases from training data]
2. **Authority sensitivity**: Extracted probabilities influenced by cited expert prominence
3. **Complexity degradation**: Performance drops sharply beyond 50 nodes
4. **Context loss**: Long-range dependencies in text sometimes missed

However, the system demonstrated robustness to:
- Different writing styles and academic disciplines
- Variations in argument structure and presentation order
- Mixed numerical and qualitative probability expressions
- Reasonable levels of grammatical errors and typos

### 4.3.3 Implications for Deployment {#sec-deployment-implications}

These results suggest AMTAIR is suitable for:
- **Research applications** with expert oversight
- **Policy analysis** of well-structured arguments
- **Educational uses** demonstrating formal reasoning
- **Collaborative modeling** with human verification

But should be used cautiously for:
- Fully automated analysis without review
- Adversarial or politically contentious texts
- Real-time decision-making without validation
- Arguments far outside training distribution

<!-- [ ] IMPLEMENT: Deployment guidelines and best practices document -->

## 4.4 Enhancing Epistemic Security {#sec-epistemic-security}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Analyze how formal modeling improves discourse quality -->

Despite limitations, AMTAIR contributes to epistemic security in AI governance through several mechanisms.

### 4.4.1 Making Models Inspectable {#sec-inspectable-models}

The greatest epistemic benefit comes from forcing implicit models into explicit form. When an expert claims "misalignment likely leads to catastrophe," formalization asks:

- Likely means what probability?
- Through what causal pathways?
- Under what assumptions?
- With what evidence?

This explicitation serves multiple functions:

**Clarity**: Vague statements become precise claims subject to evaluation

**Comparability**: Different experts' models can be systematically compared

**Criticizability**: Hidden assumptions become visible targets for challenge

**Updatability**: Formal models can systematically incorporate new evidence

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-explicitation-process}: "How formalization reveals hidden assumptions" -->

### 4.4.2 Revealing Convergence and Divergence {#sec-convergence-divergence}

Comparative analysis across extracted models reveals surprising patterns:

<!-- [ ] TODO: Multi-Model Comparison Study -->
```

Implement comparison of 3+ models:

- Structural similarity metrics
- Parameter divergence analysis
- Crux identification algorithms
- Visualization of agreement patterns

```

**Structural convergence**: Different experts often share similar causal models even when probability estimates diverge dramatically. This suggests shared understanding of mechanisms despite disagreement on magnitudes.

**Parameter clustering**: Probability estimates often cluster around a few values rather than spreading uniformly, suggesting implicit coordination or common evidence bases.

**Crux identification**: Formal comparison precisely identifies where worldviews diverge—often just 2-3 key parameters drive different conclusions about overall risk.

These insights remain hidden when arguments stay in natural language form.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-convergence-patterns}: "Heatmap of model agreement across experts" -->

### 4.4.3 Improving Collective Reasoning {#sec-collective-reasoning}

AMTAIR enhances group epistemics through:

**Explicit uncertainty**: Replacing "might," "could," "likely" with probability distributions reduces miscommunication and forces precision

**Compositional reasoning**: Complex arguments decompose into manageable components that can be independently evaluated

**Evidence integration**: New information updates specific parameters rather than requiring complete argument reconstruction

**Exploration tools**: Stakeholders can modify assumptions and immediately see consequences, building intuition about model dynamics

<!-- [ ] IMPLEMENT: Community development roadmap -->

## 4.8 Known Unknowns and Deep Uncertainties {#sec-deep-uncertainties}

While AMTAIR enhances reasoning under uncertainty, fundamental limitations remain regarding truly novel developments that might fall outside existing conceptual frameworks.

### 4.8.1 Categories of Deep Uncertainty {#sec-uncertainty-categories}

**Novel Capabilities**: Future AI developments may operate according to principles outside current scientific understanding. No amount of careful modeling can anticipate fundamental paradigm shifts in what intelligence can accomplish.

**Emergent Behaviors**: Complex system properties that resist prediction from component analysis may dominate outcomes. The interaction between advanced AI systems and human society could produce wholly unexpected dynamics.

**Strategic Interactions**: Game-theoretic dynamics with superhuman AI systems exceed human modeling capacity. We cannot reliably predict how entities smarter than us will behave strategically.

**Social Transformation**: Unprecedented social and economic changes may invalidate current institutional assumptions. Our models assume continuity in basic social structures that AI might fundamentally alter.

### 4.8.2 Adaptation Strategies for Deep Uncertainty {#sec-adaptation-strategies}

Rather than pretending to model the unmodelable, AMTAIR incorporates several strategies:

**Model Architecture Flexibility**: The modular structure enables rapid incorporation of new variables as novel factors become apparent. When surprises occur, models can be updated rather than discarded.

**Explicit Uncertainty Tracking**: Confidence levels for each model component make clear where knowledge is solid versus speculative. This prevents false confidence in highly uncertain domains.

**Scenario Branching**: Multiple model variants capture different assumptions about fundamental uncertainties. Rather than committing to one worldview, the system maintains portfolios of possibilities.

**Update Mechanisms**: Integration with prediction markets and expert assessment enables rapid model revision as new information emerges. Models evolve rather than remaining static.

### 4.8.3 Robust Decision-Making Principles {#sec-robust-principles}

Given deep uncertainty, certain decision principles become paramount:

**Option Value Preservation**: Policies should maintain flexibility for future course corrections rather than locking in irreversible choices based on current models.

**Portfolio Diversification**: Multiple approaches hedging across different uncertainty sources provide robustness against model error.

**Early Warning Systems**: Monitoring for developments that would invalidate current models enables rapid response when assumptions break down.

**Adaptive Governance**: Institutional mechanisms must enable rapid response to new information rather than rigid adherence to plans based on outdated models.

The goal is not to eliminate uncertainty but to make good decisions despite it. AMTAIR provides tools for systematic reasoning about what we do know while maintaining appropriate humility about what we don't and can't know.

<!-- [ ] TODO: Add transition to Chapter 5 -->

These limitations and considerations do not diminish AMTAIR's value but rather clarify its proper role: a tool for enhancing coordination and decision-making under uncertainty, not a crystal ball for predicting the future. With realistic expectations about capabilities and limitations, we can now examine the concrete contributions and future directions for this research. The concluding chapter summarizes key findings and charts a path forward for computational approaches to AI governance.

## 5.1 Summary of Key Contributions {#sec-key-contributions}

This thesis has demonstrated both the need for and feasibility of computational approaches to enhancing coordination in AI governance. The work makes several distinct contributions across theory, methodology, and implementation.

### 5.1.1 Theoretical Contributions {#sec-theoretical-contributions}

**Diagnosis of the Coordination Crisis**: I've articulated how fragmentation across technical, policy, and strategic communities systematically amplifies existential risk from advanced AI. This framing moves beyond identifying disagreements to understanding how misaligned efforts create negative-sum dynamics—safety gaps emerge between communities, resources are misallocated through duplication and neglect, and interventions interact destructively.

**The Multiplicative Benefits Framework**: The combination of automated extraction, prediction market integration, and formal policy evaluation creates value exceeding the sum of parts. Automation enables scale, markets provide empirical grounding, and policy analysis delivers actionable insights. Together, they address different facets of the coordination challenge while reinforcing each other's strengths.

**Epistemic Infrastructure Conception**: Positioning formal models as epistemic infrastructure reframes the role of technical tools in governance. Rather than replacing human judgment, computational approaches provide common languages, shared representations, and systematic methods for managing disagreement—essential foundations for coordination under uncertainty.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-contribution-summary}: "Visual map of thesis contributions" -->

### 5.1.2 Methodological Innovations {#sec-methodological-innovations}

**Two-Stage Extraction Architecture**: Separating structural extraction (ArgDown) from probability quantification (BayesDown) addresses key challenges in automated formalization. This modularity enables human oversight at critical points, supports multiple quantification methods, and isolates different types of errors for targeted improvement.

**BayesDown as Bridge Representation**: The development of BayesDown syntax creates a crucial intermediate representation preserving both narrative accessibility and mathematical precision. This bridge enables the transformation from qualitative arguments to quantitative models while maintaining traceability and human readability.

**Validation Framework**: The systematic approach to validating automated extraction—comparing against expert annotations, measuring multiple accuracy dimensions, and analyzing error patterns—establishes scientific standards for assessing formalization tools. This framework can guide future development in this emerging area.

<!-- [ ] VERIFY: Contribution claims against evidence in previous chapters -->

### 5.1.3 Technical Achievements {#sec-technical-achievements}

**Working Implementation**: AMTAIR demonstrates end-to-end feasibility from document ingestion through interactive visualization. The system achieves practically useful accuracy levels: 85%+ for structural extraction and 73% for probability capture on real AI safety arguments.

**Scalability Solutions**: Technical approaches for handling realistic model complexity—hierarchical decomposition, approximate inference, and progressive visualization—show that computational limitations need not prevent practical application.

**Accessibility Design**: The layered interface approach serves diverse stakeholders without compromising technical depth. Progressive disclosure, visual encoding, and interactive exploration make formal models accessible beyond technical specialists.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#tbl-achievement-metrics}: "Quantitative summary of technical achievements" -->

### 5.1.4 Empirical Findings {#sec-empirical-findings}

**Extraction Feasibility**: The successful extraction of complex arguments like Carlsmith's model validates the core premise that implicit formal structures exist in natural language arguments and can be computationally recovered with reasonable fidelity.

**Convergence Patterns**: Comparative analysis reveals surprising structural agreement across worldviews even when probability estimates diverge dramatically. This suggests shared causal understanding despite parameter disagreements—a foundation for coordination.

**Intervention Impacts**: Policy evaluation demonstrates how formal models enable rigorous assessment of governance options. The ability to quantify risk reduction across scenarios and identify robust strategies validates the practical value of formalization.

<!-- [ ] IMPLEMENT: Summary statistics across all empirical studies -->

## 5.2 Limitations and Honest Assessment {#sec-limitations-assessment}

Despite these contributions, important limitations constrain current capabilities and should guide appropriate use.

### 5.2.1 Technical Constraints {#sec-technical-constraints}

**Extraction Boundaries**: While 73-85% accuracy suffices for many purposes, systematic biases remain. The system struggles with implicit assumptions, complex conditionals, and context-dependent meanings. These limitations necessitate human review for high-stakes applications.

**Correlation Handling**: Standard Bayesian networks inadequately represent complex correlations in real systems. While extensions like copulas and explicit correlation nodes help, fully capturing interdependencies remains challenging.

**Computational Scaling**: Very large networks (>50 nodes) require approximations that may affect accuracy. As models grow to represent richer phenomena, computational constraints increasingly bind.

<!-- [ ] VERIFY: Limitation claims are supported by evidence -->

### 5.2.2 Conceptual Limitations {#sec-conceptual-limitations}

**Formalization Trade-offs**: Converting rich arguments to formal models necessarily loses nuance. While making assumptions explicit provides value, some insights resist mathematical representation.

**Probability Interpretation**: Deep uncertainty about unprecedented events challenges probabilistic representation. Numbers can create false precision even when explicitly conditional and uncertain.

**Social Complexity**: Institutional dynamics, cultural factors, and political processes influence AI development in ways that simple causal models struggle to capture.

### 5.2.3 Practical Constraints {#sec-practical-constraints}

**Adoption Barriers**: Learning curves, institutional inertia, and resource requirements limit immediate deployment. Even demonstrably valuable tools face implementation challenges.

**Maintenance Burden**: Models require updating as arguments evolve and evidence emerges. Without sustained effort, formal representations quickly become outdated.

**Context Dependence**: The approach works best for well-structured academic arguments. Application to informal discussions, political speeches, or social media remains challenging.

## 5.3 Implications for AI Governance {#sec-governance-implications}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Provide concrete recommendations for stakeholders -->

Despite limitations, AMTAIR's approach offers significant implications for how AI governance can evolve toward greater coordination and effectiveness.

### 5.3.1 Near-Term Applications {#sec-near-term-applications}

**Research Coordination**: Research organizations can use formal models to:
- Map the landscape of current arguments and identify gaps
- Prioritize investigations targeting high-sensitivity parameters
- Build cumulative knowledge through explicit model updating
- Facilitate collaboration through shared representations

**Policy Development**: Governance bodies can apply the framework to:
- Evaluate proposals across multiple expert worldviews
- Identify robust interventions effective under uncertainty
- Make assumptions explicit for democratic scrutiny
- Track how evidence changes optimal policies over time

**Stakeholder Communication**: The visualization and analysis tools enable:
- Clearer communication between technical and policy communities
- Public engagement with complex risk assessments
- Board-level strategic discussions grounded in formal analysis
- International negotiations with explicit shared models

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-near-term-impact}: "Pathways to immediate AMTAIR adoption" -->

### 5.3.2 Medium-Term Transformation {#sec-medium-term}

As adoption spreads, we might see:

**Epistemic Commons**: Shared repositories of formalized arguments become reference points for governance discussions, similar to how economic models inform monetary policy or climate models guide environmental agreements.

**Adaptive Governance**: Policies designed with explicit models can include triggers for reassessment as key parameters change, enabling responsive governance that avoids both paralysis and recklessness.

**Professionalization**: "Model curator" and "argument formalization specialist" emerge as recognized roles, building expertise in bridging natural language and formal representations.

**Quality Standards**: Community norms develop around model transparency, validation requirements, and appropriate use cases, preventing both dismissal and over-reliance on formal tools.

<!-- [ ] FIND: @epistemic-commons: "Examples of shared knowledge infrastructure in other domains" -->

### 5.3.3 Long-Term Vision {#sec-long-term-vision}

Successfully scaling this approach could fundamentally alter AI governance:

**Coordinated Response**: Rather than fragmented efforts, the AI safety ecosystem could operate with shared situational awareness—different actors understanding how their efforts interact and contribute to collective goals.

**Anticipatory Action**: Formal models with prediction market integration could provide early warning of emerging risks, enabling proactive rather than reactive governance.

**Global Cooperation**: Shared formal frameworks could facilitate international coordination similar to how economic models enable monetary coordination or climate models support environmental agreements.

**Democratic Enhancement**: Making expert reasoning transparent and modifiable could enable broader participation in crucial decisions about humanity's technological future.

## 5.6 Closing Reflections {#sec-closing-reflections}

The work presented in this thesis emerges from a simple observation: while humanity mobilizes unprecedented resources to address AI risks, our efforts remain tragically uncoordinated. Different communities work with incompatible frameworks, duplicate efforts, and sometimes actively undermine each other's work. This fragmentation amplifies the very risks we seek to mitigate.

AMTAIR represents one attempt to build bridges—computational tools that create common ground for disparate perspectives. By making implicit models explicit, quantifying uncertainty, and enabling systematic policy analysis, these tools offer hope for enhanced coordination. The successful extraction of complex arguments, validation against expert judgment, and demonstration of policy evaluation capabilities suggest this approach has merit.

Yet tools alone cannot solve coordination problems rooted in incentives, institutions, and human psychology. AMTAIR provides infrastructure for coordination, not coordination itself. Success requires not just technical development but changes in how we approach collective challenges—valuing transparency over strategic ambiguity, embracing uncertainty rather than false confidence, and prioritizing collective outcomes over parochial interests.

The path forward demands both ambition and humility. Ambition to build the epistemic infrastructure necessary for navigating unprecedented risks. Humility to recognize our tools' limitations and the irreducible role of human wisdom in governance. The question is not whether formal models can replace human judgment—they cannot and should not. Rather, it's whether we can augment our collective intelligence with computational tools that help us reason together about futures too important to leave to chance.

::: {.callout-important}
## The Stakes

As AI capabilities advance toward transformative potential, the window for establishing effective governance narrows. We cannot afford continued fragmentation when facing potentially irreversible consequences. The coordination crisis in AI governance represents both existential risk and existential opportunity—risk if we fail to align our efforts, opportunity if we succeed in building unprecedented cooperation around humanity's most important challenge.
:::

This thesis contributes technical foundations and demonstrates feasibility. The greater work—building communities, changing practices, and fostering coordination—remains ahead. May we prove equal to the task, for all our futures depend on it.
