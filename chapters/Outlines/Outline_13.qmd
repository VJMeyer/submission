The AMTAIR (Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling) system implements an end-to-end pipeline transforming unstructured arguments into interactive Bayesian networks through a novel two-stage extraction process: first capturing argument structure in ArgDown format, then enhancing it with probability information in BayesDown.

Applied to canonical examples and real AI safety arguments, the system demonstrates extraction accuracy exceeding 85% for structural relationships and 73% for probability capture. By making implicit models explicit, enabling cross-worldview comparison, and supporting rigorous policy evaluation, AMTAIR bridges communication gaps between technical researchers, policy specialists, and other stakeholders working to address existential risks from advanced AI.

The thesis contributes both theoretical foundations and practical implementation, validated through expert comparison and real-world case studies including Carlsmith's power-seeking AI model. While current limitations include correlation handling and extraction ambiguities, the approach provides essential epistemic infrastructure for coordinated AI governance. plain-language-summary: | This thesis develops software tools that automatically extract and visualize the hidden assumptions and probability estimates in AI safety arguments.

# Frontmatter: Preface {.unnumbered}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Expand preface to include personal journey and acknowledgments -->

This thesis represents the culmination of interdisciplinary research at the intersection of AI safety, formal epistemology, and computational social science. The work emerged from recognizing a fundamental challenge in AI governance: while investment in AI safety research has grown exponentially, coordination between different stakeholder communities remains fragmented, potentially increasing existential risk through misaligned efforts.

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Alternative preface from 11.7"}
The journey from initial concept to working implementation involved iterative refinement based on feedback from advisors, domain experts, and potential users. What began as a technical exercise in automated extraction evolved into a broader framework for enhancing epistemic security in one of humanity's most critical coordination challenges.
:::

I hope this work contributes to building the intellectual and technical infrastructure necessary for humanity to navigate the transition to transformative AI safely. The tools and frameworks presented here are offered in the spirit of collaborative problem-solving, recognizing that the challenges we face require unprecedented cooperation across disciplines, institutions, and worldviews.

## 1.1 Opening Scenario: The Policymaker's Dilemma {#sec-opening-scenario}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Polish opening scenario for maximum impact -->

<!-- [ ] ADD: @todd2024 add as reference for more resources towards AI safety --> 
@todd2024

Imagine a senior policy advisor preparing recommendations for AI governance legislation. On her desk lie a dozen reports from leading AI safety researchers, each painting a different picture of the risks ahead. One argues that misaligned AI could pose existential risks within the decade, citing complex technical arguments about instrumental convergence and orthogonality. Another suggests these concerns are overblown, emphasizing uncertainty and the strength of existing institutions. A third proposes specific technical standards but acknowledges deep uncertainty about their effectiveness.
<!-- [ ] EXPLAIN: in footnotes: 
a) Orthogonality Thesis:
        Intelligence and goals are independent; an AI can have any set of objectives regardless of its intelligence level.

b) Instrumental Convergence Thesis:
        Different AI systems may adopt similar instrumental goals (e.g., self-preservation, resource acquisition) to achieve their objectives.

-->
::: {.redundant-content data-better-version="Outline_12.2#sec-opening"}
Each report seems compelling in isolation, written by credentialed experts with sophisticated arguments. Yet they reach dramatically different conclusions about both the magnitude of risk and appropriate interventions. The technical arguments involve unfamiliar concepts—mesa-optimization, corrigibility, capability amplification—expressed through different frameworks and implicit assumptions. Time is limited, stakes are high, and the legislation could shape humanity's trajectory for decades.
:::

This scenario plays out daily across government offices, corporate boardrooms, and research institutions worldwide. It exemplifies what I term the "coordination crisis" in AI governance: despite unprecedented attention and resources directed toward AI safety, we lack the epistemic infrastructure to synthesize diverse expert knowledge into actionable governance strategies.

## 1.2 The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance {#sec-coordination-crisis}

@samborska2025

As AI capabilities advance at an accelerating pace—demonstrated by the rapid progression from GPT-3 to GPT-4, Claude, and emerging multimodal systems—humanity faces a governance challenge unlike any in history. The task of ensuring increasingly powerful AI systems remain aligned with human values and beneficial to our long-term flourishing grows more urgent with each capability breakthrough. This challenge becomes particularly acute when considering transformative AI systems that could drastically alter civilization's trajectory, potentially including existential risks from misaligned systems pursuing objectives counter to human welfare.

> Despite unprecedented investment in AI safety research, rapidly growing awareness among key stakeholders, and proliferating frameworks for responsible AI development, we face what I'll term the "coordination crisis" in AI governance—a systemic failure to align diverse efforts across technical, policy, and strategic domains into a coherent response proportionate to the risks we face.

The current state of AI governance presents a striking paradox. On one hand, we witness extraordinary mobilization: billions in research funding, proliferating safety initiatives, major tech companies establishing alignment teams, and governments worldwide developing AI strategies. The [Asilomar AI Principles](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/ai-principles/) garnered thousands of signatures, the EU advances [comprehensive AI regulation](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/the-act/) , and technical researchers produce increasingly sophisticated work on alignment, interpretability, and robustness.

::: {.duplicate-content data-source="Outline_11.7#sec-coordination-crisis"}
Yet alongside this activity, we observe systematic coordination failures that may prove catastrophic. Technical safety researchers develop sophisticated alignment techniques without clear implementation pathways. Policy specialists craft regulatory frameworks lacking technical grounding to ensure practical efficacy. Ethicists articulate normative principles that lack operational specificity. Strategy researchers identify critical uncertainties but struggle to translate these into actionable guidance. International bodies convene without shared frameworks for assessing interventions.

### 1.2.1 Safety Gaps from Misaligned Efforts {#sec-safety-gaps}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Document how fragmentation systematically increases risk through with specific, good examples -->

The fragmentation problem manifests in incompatible frameworks between technical researchers, policy specialists, and strategic analysts. Each community develops sophisticated approaches within their domain, yet translation between domains remains primitive. This creates systematic blind spots where risks emerge at the interfaces between technical capabilities, institutional responses, and strategic dynamics.

When different communities operate with incompatible frameworks, critical risks fall through the cracks. Technical researchers may solve alignment problems under assumptions that policymakers' decisions invalidate. Regulations optimized for current systems may inadvertently incentivize dangerous development patterns. Without shared models of the risk landscape, our collective efforts resemble the parable of blind men describing an elephant—each accurate within their domain but missing the complete picture.

### 1.2.2 Resource Misallocation {#sec-resource-misallocation}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Explain that duplicative efforts absorbing research funding, publications, and initiatives might sometimes improve reliability (think reproducing results) but tend to waste resources in expectation (opportuntity cost) -- change the tone of the paragraph accordingly  -->

The AI safety community duplicates efforts while leaving critical areas underexplored. Multiple teams independently develop similar frameworks without building on each other's work. Funders struggle to identify high-impact opportunities across technical and governance domains. Talent flows toward well-publicized approaches while neglected strategies remain understaffed. This misallocation becomes more costly as the window for establishing effective governance narrows.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#tbl-resource-duplication}: "Examples of duplicated AI safety efforts across organizations" -->

### 1.2.3 Negative-Sum Dynamics {#sec-negative-sum}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Address capability-governance gaps widening with accelerating development -->

Perhaps most concerning, uncoordinated interventions can actively increase risk. Safety standards that advantage established players may accelerate risky development elsewhere. Partial transparency requirements might enable capability advances without commensurate safety improvements. International agreements lacking shared technical understanding may lock in dangerous practices. Without coordination, our cure risks becoming worse than the disease.

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Outline_11.7#systematic-risk"}
Coordination failures systematically amplify existential risk through multiple pathways. Safety gaps emerge when technical solutions lack policy implementation pathways. Resource misallocation occurs when multiple teams unknowingly duplicate efforts while critical areas remain unaddressed. Most perniciously, locally optimized decisions by individual actors can create negative-sum dynamics that increase overall risk—an AI governance tragedy of the commons.

## 1.3 Historical Parallels and Temporal Urgency {#sec-historical-urgency}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Draw connections to nuclear governance, climate change, and biosecurity -->

History offers instructive parallels. The nuclear age began with scientists racing to understand and control forces that could destroy civilization. Early coordination failures—competing national programs, scientist-military tensions, public-expert divides—nearly led to catastrophe multiple times. Only through developing shared frameworks (deterrence theory), institutions (IAEA), and communication channels (hotlines, treaties) did humanity navigate the nuclear precipice.

@rehman2025

::: {.redundant-content data-better-version="Outline_12.2#temporal-urgency"} 
Yet AI presents unique coordination challenges that compress our response timeline:

**Accelerating Development**: Unlike nuclear weapons requiring massive infrastructure, AI development proceeds in corporate labs and academic departments worldwide. Capability improvements come through algorithmic insights and computational scale, both advancing exponentially.

**Dual-Use Ubiquity**: Every AI advance potentially contributes to both beneficial applications and catastrophic risks. The same language model architectures enabling scientific breakthroughs could facilitate dangerous manipulation or deception at scale.

**Comprehension Barriers**: Nuclear risks were viscerally understandable—cities vaporized, radiation sickness, nuclear winter. AI risks involve abstract concepts like optimization processes, goal misspecification, and emergent capabilities that resist intuitive understanding.

**Governance Lag**: Traditional governance mechanisms—legislation, international treaties, professional standards—operate on timescales of years to decades. AI capabilities advance on timescales of months to years, creating an ever-widening capability-governance gap.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-governance-lag}: "Timeline comparison of AI capability vs governance development" -->

## 1.4 Research Question and Scope {#sec-research-question}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Clearly articulate the primary research question with precision -->

This thesis addresses a specific dimension of the coordination challenge by investigating the question:

**Can frontier AI technologies be utilized to automate the modeling of transformative AI risks, enabling robust prediction of policy impacts across diverse worldviews?**

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Outline_11.7#research-question"} 
More specifically, I explore whether frontier language models can automate the extraction and formalization of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature, creating a scalable computational framework that enhances coordination in AI governance through systematic policy evaluation under uncertainty. 
:::

To break this down into its components:

- **Frontier AI Technologies**: Today's most capable language models (GPT-4, Claude-3 level systems)
- **Automated Modeling**: Using these systems to extract and formalize argument structures from natural language
- **Transformative AI Risks**: Potentially catastrophic outcomes from advanced AI systems, particularly existential risks
- **Policy Impact Prediction**: Evaluating how governance interventions might alter probability distributions over outcomes
- **Diverse Worldviews**: Accounting for fundamental disagreements about AI development trajectories and risk factors

The investigation encompasses both theoretical development and practical implementation, focusing specifically on existential risks from misaligned AI systems rather than broader AI ethics concerns. This narrowed scope enables deep technical development while addressing the highest-stakes coordination challenges.

## 1.5 The Multiplicative Benefits Framework {#sec-multiplicative-benefits}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Establish central thesis about synergistic combination of three elements -->

The central thesis of this work is that combining three elements—automated worldview extraction, prediction market integration, and formal policy evaluation—creates multiplicative rather than merely additive benefits for AI governance. Each component enhances the others, creating a system more valuable than the sum of its parts.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-multiplicative-benefits}: "Venn diagram showing synergies between extraction, markets, and evaluation": 	Automation × Live Prediction Market Integrations × Policy Impact Evaluations

### 1.5.1 Automated Worldview Extraction {#sec-automated-extraction}

::: {.duplicate-content data-source="Outline_11.7#automated-extraction"} 
**Automated worldview extraction** using frontier language models addresses the scaling bottleneck in current approaches to AI risk modeling. The Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project demonstrated the value of formal representation but required extensive manual effort to translate qualitative arguments into quantitative models. Automation enables processing orders of magnitude more content, incorporating diverse perspectives, and maintaining models in near real-time as new arguments emerge. 
:::

Current approaches to AI risk modeling, exemplified by the Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project, demonstrate the value of formal representation but require extensive manual effort. Creating a single model demands dozens of expert-hours to translate qualitative arguments into quantitative frameworks. This bottleneck severely limits the number of perspectives that can be formalized and the speed of model updates as new arguments emerge.

<!-- [-] VERIFIED FALSE: @mtair-effort: "Bucknall et al. (2022) - specific hour estimates for manual modeling" NO SUCH SOURCE EXIST. REMOVE ANY MENTIONS! -->

Automation using frontier language models addresses this scaling challenge. By developing systematic methods to extract causal structures and probability judgments from natural language, we can:

- Process orders of magnitude more content
- Incorporate diverse perspectives rapidly
- Maintain models that evolve with the discourse
- Reduce barriers to entry for contributing worldviews

### 1.5.2 Live Data Integration {#sec-live-data}

::: {.redundant-content data-better-version="Outline_12.2#prediction-markets"} 
**Prediction market integration** grounds these models in collective forecasting intelligence. By connecting formal representations to live forecasting platforms, the system can incorporate timely judgments about critical uncertainties from calibrated forecasters. This creates a dynamic feedback loop where models inform forecasters and forecasts update models. 
:::

Static models, however well-constructed, quickly become outdated in fast-moving domains. Prediction markets and forecasting platforms aggregate distributed knowledge about uncertain futures, providing continuously updated probability estimates. By connecting formal models to these live data sources, we create dynamic assessments that incorporate the latest collective intelligence.

This integration serves multiple purposes:

- Grounding abstract models in empirical forecasts
- Identifying which uncertainties most affect outcomes
- Revealing when model assumptions diverge from collective expectations
- Generating new questions for forecasting communities

<!-- [ ] ADD: @tetlock2015 and introduce prediction markets for a general audience, explain how they can be used in forecasting technological developments and impacts -->
@tetlock2015

### 1.5.3 Formal Policy Evaluation {#sec-policy-evaluation}

**Formal policy evaluation** transforms static risk assessments into actionable guidance by modeling how specific interventions alter critical parameters. Using causal inference techniques, we can assess not just the probability of adverse outcomes but how those probabilities change under different policy regimes.

This enables genuinely evidence-based policy development:

- Comparing interventions across multiple worldviews
- Identifying robust strategies that work across scenarios
- Understanding which uncertainties most affect policy effectiveness
- Prioritizing research to reduce decision-relevant uncertainty

@pearl2000 and @pearl2009

### 1.5.4 The Synergy {#sec-synergy}

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Outline_11.7#synergy"} 
The synergy emerges because automation enables comprehensive data integration, markets inform and validate models, and evaluation gains precision from both automated extraction and market-based calibration. The complete system creates feedback loops where policy analysis identifies critical uncertainties for market attention. 
:::

The multiplicative benefits emerge from the interactions between components:

- Automation enables comprehensive coverage, making prediction market integration more valuable by connecting to more perspectives
- Market data validates and calibrates automated extractions, improving quality
- Policy evaluation gains precision from both comprehensive models and live probability updates
- The complete system creates feedback loops where policy analysis identifies critical uncertainties for market attention

This synergistic combination addresses the coordination crisis by providing common ground for disparate communities, translating between technical and policy languages, quantifying previously implicit disagreements, and enabling evidence-based compromise.

## 1.6 Thesis Structure and Roadmap {#sec-roadmap}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Preview the logical progression of the thesis -->

The remainder of this thesis develops the multiplicative benefits framework from theoretical foundations to practical implementation:

::: {.duplicate-content data-source="Outline_11.7#roadmap"} 
**Chapter 2: Context and Theoretical Foundations** establishes the intellectual groundwork, examining the epistemic challenges unique to AI governance, Bayesian networks as formal tools for uncertainty representation, argument mapping as a bridge from natural language to formal models, the MTAIR project's achievements and limitations, and requirements for effective coordination infrastructure.

**Chapter 3: AMTAIR Design and Implementation** presents the technical system including overall architecture and design principles, the two-stage extraction pipeline (ArgDown → BayesDown), validation methodology and results, case studies from simple examples to complex AI risk models, and integration with prediction markets and policy evaluation.

**Chapter 4: Discussion - Implications and Limitations** critically examines technical limitations and failure modes, conceptual concerns about formalization, integration with existing governance frameworks, scaling challenges and opportunities, and broader implications for epistemic security.

**Chapter 5: Conclusion** synthesizes key contributions and charts paths forward with a summary of theoretical and practical achievements, concrete recommendations for stakeholders, research agenda for community development, and vision for AI governance with proper coordination infrastructure. 
:::

Throughout this progression, I maintain dual focus on theoretical sophistication and practical utility. The framework aims not merely to advance academic understanding but to provide actionable tools for improving coordination in AI governance during this critical period.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-thesis-roadmap}: "Visual flowchart of thesis structure and chapter connections" -->

Having established the coordination crisis and outlined how automated modeling can address it, we now turn to the theoretical foundations that make this approach possible. The next chapter examines the unique epistemic challenges of AI governance and introduces the formal tools—particularly Bayesian networks—that enable rigorous reasoning under deep uncertainty.

Carlsmith's "Is Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk?" (2021) represents one of the most structured approaches to assessing the probability of existential catastrophe from advanced AI. The analysis decomposes the overall risk into six key premises, each with an explicit probability estimate. 
:::

To ground our discussion in concrete terms, I examine Joseph Carlsmith's "Is Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk?" as an exemplar of structured reasoning about AI catastrophic risk. Carlsmith's analysis stands out for its explicit probabilistic decomposition of the path from current AI development to potential existential catastrophe.

### 2.1.1 Six-Premise Decomposition {#sec-six-premise}

<!-- [ ] ADD: @clarke2022 citation -->

::: {.duplicate-content data-source="Outline_11.7#six-premise"} 
According to the MTAIR model Carlsmith decomposes existential risk into a probabilistic chain with explicit estimates:

1. **Premise 1**: Transformative AI development this century $(P ≈ 0.80)$
2. **Premise 2**: AI systems pursuing objectives in the world $(P ≈ 0.95)$
3. **Premise 3**: Systems with power-seeking instrumental incentives $(P ≈ 0.40)$
4. **Premise 4**: Sufficient capability for existential threat $(P ≈ 0.65)$
5. **Premise 5**: Misaligned systems despite safety efforts $(P ≈ 0.50)$
6. **Premise 6**: Catastrophic outcomes from misaligned power-seeking $(P ≈ 0.65)$

**Composite Risk Calculation**: $P(doom) ≈ 0.05$ (5%) 
:::

<!-- [ ] CREATE: Mermaid flowchart of Carlsmith model with probabilities (in correct Quarto Syntax)-->

Carlsmith structures his argument through six conditional premises, each assigned explicit probability estimates:

**Premise 1: APS Systems by 2070** $(P ≈ 0.65)$^[The probability estimates vary between outlines; using more conservative estimates from 12.2] "By 2070, there will be AI systems with Advanced capability, Agentic planning, and Strategic awareness"—the conjunction of capabilities that could enable systematic pursuit of objectives in the world.

**Premise 2: Alignment Difficulty** $(P ≈ 0.40)  $
"It will be harder to build aligned APS systems than misaligned systems that are still attractive to deploy"—capturing the challenge that safety may conflict with capability or efficiency.

**Premise 3: Deployment Despite Misalignment** $(P ≈ 0.70)  $
"Conditional on 1 and 2, we will deploy misaligned APS systems"—reflecting competitive pressures and limited coordination.

**Premise 4: Power-Seeking Behavior** $(P ≈ 0.65)  $
"Conditional on 1-3, misaligned APS systems will seek power in high-impact ways"—based on instrumental convergence arguments.

**Premise 5: Disempowerment Success** $(P ≈ 0.40)  $
"Conditional on 1-4, power-seeking will scale to permanent human disempowerment"—despite potential resistance and safeguards.

**Premise 6: Existential Catastrophe** $(P ≈ 0.95)  $
"Conditional on 1-5, this disempowerment constitutes existential catastrophe"—connecting power loss to permanent curtailment of human potential.

**Overall Risk**: Multiplying through the conditional chain yields $P(doom) ≈ 0.05$ or 5% by 2070.

This structured approach exemplifies the type of reasoning AMTAIR aims to formalize and automate. While Carlsmith spent months developing this model manually, similar rigor exists implicitly in many AI safety arguments awaiting extraction.

### 2.1.2 Why Carlsmith Exemplifies Formalizable Arguments {#sec-carlsmith-formalizable}

::: {.redundant-content data-better-version="Outline_11.7#carlsmith-ideal"} 
Carlsmith's model represents "low-hanging fruit" for automated formalization because it already exhibits explicit probabilistic reasoning with clear conditional dependencies. Success with this structured argument validates the approach for less explicit arguments throughout AI safety literature. 
:::

Carlsmith's model demonstrates several features that make it ideal for formal representation:

**Explicit Probabilistic Structure**: Each premise receives numerical probability estimates with documented reasoning, enabling direct translation to Bayesian network parameters.

**Clear Conditional Dependencies**: The logical flow from capabilities through deployment decisions to catastrophic outcomes maps naturally onto directed acyclic graphs.

**Transparent Decomposition**: Breaking the argument into modular premises allows independent evaluation and sensitivity analysis of each component.

**Documented Reasoning**: Extensive justification for each probability enables extraction of both structure and parameters from the source text.

## 2.2 The Epistemic Challenge of Policy Evaluation {#sec-epistemic-challenge}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Explain why evaluating AI governance policies is particularly difficult -->

AI governance policy evaluation faces unique epistemic challenges that render traditional policy analysis methods insufficient. Understanding these challenges motivates the need for new computational approaches.



### 2.2.1 Unique Characteristics of AI Governance {#sec-ai-governance-unique}

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Outline_11.7#epistemic-challenge"} 
AI governance policy evaluation faces unique epistemic challenges that render traditional policy analysis methods insufficient. The domain combines complex causal chains with limited empirical grounding, deep uncertainty about future capabilities, divergent stakeholder worldviews, and few opportunities for experimental testing before deployment. 
:::

**Deep Uncertainty Rather Than Risk**: Traditional policy analysis distinguishes between risk (known probability distributions) and uncertainty (known possibilities, unknown probabilities). AI governance faces deep uncertainty—we cannot confidently enumerate possible futures, much less assign probabilities. Will recursive self-improvement enable rapid capability gains? Can value alignment be solved technically? These foundational questions resist empirical resolution before their answers become catastrophically relevant.

**Complex Multi-Level Causation**: Policy effects propagate through technical, institutional, and social levels with intricate feedback loops. A technical standard might alter research incentives, shifting capability development trajectories, changing competitive dynamics, and ultimately affecting existential risk through pathways invisible at the policy's inception. Traditional linear causal models cannot capture these dynamics.

**Irreversibility and Lock-In**: Many AI governance decisions create path dependencies that prove difficult or impossible to reverse. Early technical standards shape development trajectories. Institutional structures ossify. International agreements create sticky equilibria. Unlike many policy domains where course correction remains possible, AI governance mistakes may prove permanent.

**Value-Laden Technical Choices**: The entanglement of technical and normative questions confounds traditional separation of facts and values. What constitutes "alignment"? How much capability development should we risk for economic benefits? Technical specifications embed ethical judgments that resist neutral expertise.




<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#tbl-governance-challenges}: "Comparison of AI governance vs traditional policy domains" -->








### 2.2.2 Limitations of Traditional Approaches {#sec-traditional-limitations}

::: {.duplicate-content data-source="Outline_11.7#traditional-limitations"} 
Traditional methods fall short in several ways. Cost-benefit analysis struggles with existential outcomes and deep uncertainty about unprecedented events. Scenario planning often lacks the probabilistic reasoning necessary for rigorous evaluation under uncertainty. Expert elicitation alone fails to formalize interdependencies between variables and make assumptions explicit. Qualitative approaches obscure crucial assumptions that drive conclusions, making it difficult to identify cruxes of disagreement. 
:::

Standard policy evaluation tools prove inadequate for these challenges:

**Cost-Benefit Analysis** assumes commensurable outcomes and stable probability distributions. When potential outcomes include existential catastrophe with deeply uncertain probabilities, the mathematical machinery breaks down. Infinite negative utility resists standard decision frameworks.

**Scenario Planning** helps explore possible futures but typically lacks the probabilistic reasoning needed for decision-making under uncertainty. Without quantification, scenarios provide narrative richness but limited action guidance.

**Expert Elicitation** aggregates specialist judgment but struggles with interdisciplinary questions where no single expert grasps all relevant factors. Moreover, experts often operate with different implicit models, making aggregation problematic.

**Red Team Exercises** test specific plans but miss systemic risks emerging from component interactions. Gaming individual failures cannot reveal emergent catastrophic possibilities.

These limitations create a methodological gap: we need approaches that handle deep uncertainty, represent complex causation, quantify expert disagreement, and enable systematic exploration of intervention effects.

### 2.2.4 Toward New Epistemic Tools {#sec-new-epistemic-tools}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Bridge from limitations to the need for automated, computational approaches -->

The inadequacy of traditional methods for AI governance creates an urgent need for new epistemic tools. These tools must:

- **Handle Deep Uncertainty**: Move beyond point estimates to represent ranges of possibilities
- **Capture Complex Causation**: Model multi-level interactions and feedback loops
- **Quantify Disagreement**: Make explicit where experts diverge and why
- **Enable Systematic Analysis**: Support rigorous comparison of policy options

::: {.callout-tip}

## Key Insight

The computational approaches developed in this thesis—particularly Bayesian networks enhanced with automated extraction—directly address each of these requirements by providing formal frameworks for reasoning under uncertainty.

<!-- [ ] ADD: @mccaslin2024 cite and write about "Conditional Trees: A Method for Generating Informative Questions about Complex Topics" 
Abstract:
>   We test a new process for generating high-value forecasting questions: asking experts to produce “conditional trees,” simplified Bayesian networks of quantifiably informative forecasting questions. We test this technique in the context of the current debate about risks from AI. We conduct structured interviews with 21 AI domain experts and 3 highly skilled generalist forecasters (“superforecasters”) to generate 75 forecasting questions that would cause participants to significantly update their views about AI risk. We elicit the “Value of Information” (VOI) each question provides for a far-future outcome—whether AI will cause human extinction by 2100—by collecting conditional forecasts from superforecasters (n=8).[2] In a comparison with the highest-engagement AI questions on two forecasting platforms, the average conditional trees-generated question resolving in 2030 was nine times more informative than the comparison AI-related platform questions (p = .025). This report provides initial evidence that structured interviews of experts focused on generating informative cruxes can produce higher-VOI questions than status quo methods.

In this question series, FRI invites you to forecast on the case study's "ultimate question" (Before 2100, will AI cause the human population to fall below 5000 individuals?) along with four questions that were found to be most informative nearer-term indicators of the ultimate question. Then, you can forecast four conditional pairs that combine the ultimate question with each of the four indicator questions. We're excited to see how the forecasts of the Metaculus community compare to those in the study.

## 2.3 Bayesian Networks as Knowledge Representation {#sec-bayesian-networks}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Introduce Bayesian networks as formal tools for representing uncertainty -->

Bayesian networks offer a mathematical framework uniquely suited to addressing these epistemic challenges. By combining graphical structure with probability theory, they provide tools for reasoning about complex uncertain domains.

### 2.3.1 Mathematical Foundations {#sec-mathematical-foundations}


A Bayesian network consists of:

- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: Nodes represent variables, edges represent direct dependencies
- **Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs)**: For each node, P(node|parents) quantifies relationships

The joint probability distribution factors according to the graph structure:
<!-- [ ] CHECK: if this equation is correct -->
$$
 P(X1,X2,...,Xn)=∏i=1nP(Xi∣Parents(Xi))P(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n) 
 = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i | Parents(X_i))P(X1​,X2​,...,Xn​)=i=1∏n​P(Xi​∣Parents(Xi​)) 
$$

This factorization enables efficient inference and embodies causal assumptions explicitly.

### 2.1  Risk Management: Concepts and Scope {#sec-risk-management}

Risk management is the *systematic* process of **identifying, analysing, prioritising, and treating** uncertainties that could hinder—or enhance—organisational objectives. While the popular focus is loss prevention, rigorous frameworks also *maximise upside* by surfacing and exploiting favourable probabilities.



#### 2.1.1  Representative Risk Classes

| Control influence                  | Illustrative categories\*                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Partially / fully controllable** | Health & safety, credit/default, counter-party, reputation            |
| **Largely external**               | Market/systematic, foreign-exchange, inflationary, political, country |

\* Sophisticated financial institutions routinely monitor **50-100+** discrete risk classes.

---

### 2.2  Traditional Risk-Modelling Paradigms {#sec-trad-risk}

| Approach         | Core traits                                                | Common artefact                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Qualitative**  | Narrative ranking without formal aggregation               | Risk register (“shopping list”)              |
| **Quantitative** | Mathematical model enables scenario & sensitivity analysis | *Bow-tie* diagrams, Monte-Carlo sheets, etc. |


> **False sense of security**
> Listing a hazard can be mis-interpreted as mitigation. Effective governance *requires* explicit controls and ownership.


*Risk registers* remain widespread, yet they seldom capture causal structure or allow inference. *Bow-tie models* extend the register by layering causes and consequences, but—without a principled calculus—still struggle with:

* bidirectional reasoning
* missing data
* non-monotonic logic
* integrated decision optimisation



### 2.3  Bayesian Networks: A Unifying Framework {#sec-bn-framework}

Bayesian Networks (BNs) provide the missing rigorous backbone:

* **Causal representation** – directed acyclic graph (DAG) encodes cause→effect.
* **Native uncertainty handling** – probabilities on nodes/edges.
* **Bidirectional inference** – update causes from effects (*diagnostic*) and vice-versa (*predictive*).
* **Data + expert fusion** – structure and parameters can be learned, elicited, or hybrid.
* **Missing data tolerance** – inference proceeds with partial evidence.
* **Decision optimisation** – via Decision Graphs (BN + decision & utility nodes).

"Why Not Simple Scores?"
> Ad-hoc scoring schemes cannot be algebraically combined, forbid reverse reasoning, and often yield distorted priorities. Probabilities and utilities preserve coherence.




### 2.4  Building a Bayesian Risk Model {#sec-build-bn}

1. **Define variables** — threats, controls, events, consequences.
2. **Connect causes→effects** — manual expert linkage, structure learning, or reusable templates.
3. **Parameterise**

   * *Expert elicitation* (interviews, Delphi)
   * *Data-driven learning* (MLE/Bayesian updating)
4. **Validate & iterate** — out-of-sample testing, stakeholder review.
5. **Analyse** — “what-if”, sensitivity, impact, value-of-information.

> Evidence Optimisation
> BayesServer’s *Evidence Optimisation* finds the evidence set that maximises (or goal-seeks) a chosen outcome—powerful for selecting monitoring signals under budget constraints.

### 2.5  Advanced Analytic & Diagnostic Techniques {#sec-adv-analytics}

| Technique                 | Purpose                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strength-of-influence** | Quantify dependency magnitude between node pairs.                                     |
| **Impact analysis**       | Rank inputs by contribution to target uncertainty.                                    |
| **Anomaly detection**     | Alert when new data deviates from model fit (log-likelihood, conflict).               |
| **Value of information**  | Identify observations that would most reduce uncertainty (with or without utilities). |
| **Expert disagreement**   | Weight diverging expert CPTs dynamically; enables on-line performance updating.       |
| **D-separation**          | Detect variables currently irrelevant to a query under given evidence.                |



### 2.6  Decision Optimisation & Utilities {#sec-decision-opt}

**Decision Graphs** augment BNs with:

* `Decision` nodes — alternative actions/policies.
* `Utility` nodes — monetary cost, *Quality-Adjusted Life Years* (QALY), etc.

Expected Utility Maximisation yields the optimal policy under uncertainty.


> *Health technology assessment* agencies routinely assign monetary values to human life-years to compare treatment strategies.




### 2.7  Handling Complexity & Uncertainty {#sec-complexity}

* **Hierarchical models** mirror organisational structures; sub-nets roll up to enterprise view.
* **Dynamic BNs (DBNs)** model explicit temporal evolution when lag effects are critical.
* **Noisy-OR/AND nodes** keep CPTs tractable with many parents (common in medical/risk diagnosis).
* **Soft evidence** encodes partial beliefs (e.g. Threat = {None 0.4, Low 0.6}).



### 2.8  Summary {#sec-summary-risk}

Bayesian Networks—and their decision-theoretic extension—offer a *coherent, extensible, and analytically rich* foundation for risk management. They subsume traditional qualitative lists and ad-hoc quantitative tools into a single probabilistic engine capable of:

* modelling intricate causal chains,
* integrating expert judgement **and** empirical data,
* diagnosing model fit in real time, and
* prescribing *optimal* interventions aligned with organisational utilities.

Within **AMTAIR**, BNs operationalise the thesis goal: *automating the extraction and formalisation of probabilistic world models* to evaluate AI governance strategies under deep uncertainty.

```
[Grass_Wet]: Concentrated moisture on grass.

- **Sprinkler** (intermediate): P(sprinkler|rain) varies by rain state
- **Grass_Wet** (effect): P(wet|rain, sprinkler) depends on both causes

<!-- [ ] CREATE: Mermaid flowchart of Rain-Sprinkler-Grass model with probabilities (in correct Quarto Syntax)-->






python

```python
# Basic network representation
nodes = ['Rain', 'Sprinkler', 'Grass_Wet']
edges = [('Rain', 'Sprinkler'), ('Rain', 'Grass_Wet'), ('Sprinkler', 'Grass_Wet')]

# Conditional probability specification
P_wet_given_causes = {
    (True, True): 0.99,    # Rain=T, Sprinkler=T
    (True, False): 0.80,   # Rain=T, Sprinkler=F  
    (False, True): 0.90,   # Rain=F, Sprinkler=T
    (False, False): 0.01   # Rain=F, Sprinkler=F

### 2.3.3 Advantages for AI Risk Modeling {#sec-modeling-advantages}

::: {.redundant-content data-better-version="Outline_11.7#modeling-advantages"} 
Bayesian networks offer several key advantages for AI risk modeling. They provide explicit uncertainty representation where all beliefs are represented with probability distributions rather than point estimates. The framework naturally supports causal reasoning through native support for intervention analysis and counterfactual reasoning via do-calculus. Evidence integration becomes principled through Bayesian updating mechanisms. The modular structure allows complex arguments to be decomposed into manageable, verifiable components. Finally, the visual communication provided by graphical representation facilitates understanding across different expertise levels. 
:::

These features address key requirements for AI governance:

- **Handling Uncertainty**: Every parameter is a distribution, not a point estimate
- **Representing Causation**: Directed edges embody causal relationships
- **Enabling Analysis**: Formal inference algorithms support systematic evaluation
- **Facilitating Communication**: Visual structure aids cross-domain understanding








## 2.4 Argument Mapping and Formal Representations {#sec-argument-mapping}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Bridge informal reasoning to formal models -->

The gap between natural language arguments and formal models requires systematic bridging. Argument mapping provides methods for making implicit reasoning structures explicit and analyzable.

### 2.4.1 From Natural Language to Structure {#sec-natural-to-structure}

Natural language arguments contain rich information expressed through:

- Causal claims ("X leads to Y")
- Conditional relationships ("If A then likely B")
- Uncertainty expressions ("probably," "might," "certainly")
- Support/attack patterns between claims

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Outline_11.7#argument-mapping"}

### 2.4.2 ArgDown: Structured Argument Notation {#sec-argdown-notation}

<!-- [ ] ADD: @voigt2025 from url: https://argdown.org/ and https://github.com/christianvoigt/argdown add as reference for argdown 
-->

@voigt2025


ArgDown provides a markdown-like syntax for hierarchical argument representation:

```
[MainClaim]: Description of primary conclusion.
 + [SupportingEvidence]: Evidence supporting the claim.
   + [SubEvidence]: More specific support.
 - [CounterArgument]: Evidence against the claim.
```

This notation captures argument structure while remaining human-readable and writable. Crucially, it serves as an intermediate representation between natural language and formal models.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-argdown-example}: "Side-by-side comparison of text argument and ArgDown representation" -->




Argument mapping provides a bridge between natural language reasoning and formal probabilistic models, enabling the transformation of complex qualitative arguments into structured representations suitable for computational analysis. This section explores two key intermediate representations—ArgDown and BayesDown—that facilitate this transformation process.

Argument maps are structured visualizations that represent the logical relationships between claims, evidence, and objections. Unlike free-form text, they make explicit how different statements support or challenge one another, forcing clarity about the logical structure of arguments. Traditional argument maps typically include:

- Statements (claims, premises, conclusions) presented as nodes
- Support and attack relationships shown as arrows between nodes
- Hierarchical organization reflecting logical dependencies

These visualizations help identify unstated assumptions, circular reasoning, and gaps in argumentation. However, traditional argument mapping has limited expressivity for representing uncertainty—a crucial element in complex domains like AI risk assessment.

ArgDown extends the concept of argument mapping into a structured text format with a consistent syntax. Developed by Christian Voigt with support from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, ArgDown provides a markdown-like notation for representing arguments in a hierarchical structure that can be automatically visualized and analyzed. The basic syntax is:

argdown
```markdown
[Statement]: Description of the statement.
 + [Supporting_Statement]: Description of supporting statement.
   + [Further_Support]: Description of additional support.
 - [Opposing_Statement]: Description of opposing statement.
```

For the AMTAIR project, we adapt ArgDown to focus on causal relationships rather than general argumentation, using a modified syntax where the hierarchical structure represents causal influence:

```json
[Effect]: Description of effect. {"instantiations": ["effect_TRUE", "effect_FALSE"]}
 + [Cause1]: Description of first cause. {"instantiations": ["cause1_TRUE", "cause1_FALSE"]}
 + [Cause2]: Description of second cause. {"instantiations": ["cause2_TRUE", "cause2_FALSE"]}
   + [Root_Cause]: A cause that influences Cause2. {"instantiations": ["root_TRUE", "root_FALSE"]}
```

This adaptation adds metadata in JSON format to specify possible states (instantiations) of each variable, preparing the structure for probabilistic enhancement. The hierarchical relationships (indented with plus signs) represent causal influence, creating a directed graph structure.

This representation:

- **Preserves narrative structure** from the original argument
- **Adds mathematical precision** through probability specifications
- **Enables transformation** to standard Bayesian network formats
- **Supports validation** by maintaining traceability to sources

The two-stage extraction process (ArgDown → BayesDown) separates concerns: first capturing structure, then quantifying relationships. This modularity enables human oversight at critical decision points.

<!-- [ ] ADD: bayesdown-syntax is Own creation (aspires to become a new standard based on ArgDown) "Link to full BayesDown specification in appendix" -->

The intermediate representations (ArgDown and BayesDown) remain human-readable, maintaining the connection to the original arguments while enabling computational analysis.

The key innovation in this approach is the separation of structure extraction from probability quantification, which aligns with how experts typically approach complex arguments. First, they identify what factors matter and how they relate causally, then they consider how probable different scenarios are based on those relationships. This two-stage process makes the extraction more robust and the resulting representations more interpretable.


## 2.5 The MTAIR Framework: Achievements and Limitations {#sec-mtair-framework}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Explain the MTAIR project's methodological approach -->

The Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project, led by RAND researchers, pioneered formal modeling of AI existential risk arguments. Understanding its approach and limitations motivates the automation efforts of AMTAIR.

### 2.5.1 MTAIR's Approach {#sec-mtair-approach}

The Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project, led by David Manheim and colleagues, represents a significant precursor to the current research. Launched in 2021, MTAIR aimed to create structured representations of existential risks from advanced AI using Bayesian networks, directed acyclic graphs, and probabilistic modeling. Understanding its achievements and limitations provides important context for the current AMTAIR approach.

MTAIR emerged from the recognition that AI risk discussions often involved complex causal arguments with implicit probability judgments that were difficult to compare or integrate. By formalizing these arguments in structured models, the project sought to make assumptions explicit, enable quantitative analysis, and facilitate more productive discourse across different perspectives on AI risk.

The framework's key innovations included:

1. **Explicit representation of uncertainty through probability distributions:** Rather than presenting point estimates, MTAIR captured uncertainty about parameters using distributions, acknowledging the significant uncertainty in AI risk assessment.
    
2. **Hierarchical structure for complex scenarios:** The approach used nested models that allowed exploration of different levels of detail, from high-level risk factors to specific technical mechanisms.
    
3. **Integration of diverse expert judgments:** The framework incorporated perspectives from various specialists, creating a more comprehensive view than any single expert could provide.
    
4. **Sensitivity analysis methodology:** MTAIR developed techniques for identifying which parameters most significantly affected risk estimates, helping prioritize research efforts.
    

The project's practical impact extended beyond its technical achievements. It influenced research prioritization by identifying critical uncertainties that warranted further investigation. It enhanced discourse quality by providing a shared vocabulary and structure for discussing causal pathways to risk. It also created visual representations that made complex arguments more accessible to stakeholders without technical backgrounds.

Despite these achievements, MTAIR faced several important limitations:

1. **Manual labor intensity limiting scalability:** Creating and updating models required substantial expert time, limiting the number and complexity of models that could be developed and maintained. As one team member noted, "It often took several days of work to formalize even relatively straightforward arguments."
    
2. **Static nature of models once constructed:** The models were essentially snapshots that did not automatically update as new information emerged, requiring manual revision to remain current.
    
3. **Limited accessibility for non-technical stakeholders:** While visual representations improved accessibility, understanding and interacting with the models still required specialized knowledge.
    
4. **Challenges in representing multiple worldviews simultaneously:** Comparing different perspectives required creating separate models, making it difficult to identify specific points of agreement and disagreement.
    

These limitations motivate the current research in automating the extraction and transformation process. As AI capabilities advance and the volume of relevant research grows, manual approaches cannot keep pace with the need for comprehensive, up-to-date models. Automation addresses the scalability limitation by dramatically reducing the time required to create formal representations of expert arguments.

Moreover, incorporating frontier LLMs into the pipeline enables new capabilities that were not feasible in the original MTAIR framework. These include:

1. Processing larger volumes of literature to capture more diverse perspectives
2. Generating intermediate representations that preserve narrative structure
3. Automating the creation of probability questions based on model structure
4. Facilitating integration with live data sources for continuous updates

By building on MTAIR's foundation while addressing its key limitations, the current research maintains continuity with established approaches to AI risk modeling while pushing the boundaries of what's possible through automation and enhanced representation formats.

The evolution from MTAIR to AMTAIR represents a natural progression: as the field matures and the challenges become more pressing, more sophisticated tools are needed to facilitate coordination and decision-making. Automation doesn't replace expert judgment but amplifies it, allowing insights to be captured, formalized, and shared more efficiently across the AI governance community.

The Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project demonstrated the value of formal probabilistic modeling for AI safety, but also revealed significant limitations in the manual approach. While MTAIR successfully translated complex arguments into Bayesian networks and enabled sensitivity analysis, the intensive human labor required for model creation limited both scalability and timeliness.
:::

MTAIR manually translated influential AI risk arguments into Bayesian networks using Analytica software:

**Systematic Decomposition**: Breaking complex arguments into variables and relationships through expert analysis.

**Probability Elicitation**: Gathering quantitative estimates through structured expert interviews and literature review.

**Sensitivity Analysis**: Identifying which parameters most influence conclusions about AI risk levels.

**Visual Communication**: Creating interactive models that stakeholders could explore and modify.

### 2.5.2 Key Achievements {#sec-mtair-achievements}

MTAIR demonstrated several important possibilities:

**Feasibility of Formalization**: Complex philosophical arguments about AI risk can be represented as Bayesian networks while preserving essential insights.

**Value of Quantification**: Moving from qualitative concerns to quantitative models enables systematic analysis, comparison, and prioritization.

**Cross-Perspective Communication**: Formal models provide common ground for technical and policy communities to engage productively.

**Research Prioritization**: Sensitivity analysis reveals which empirical questions would most reduce uncertainty about AI risks.

### 2.5.3 Fundamental Limitations {#sec-mtair-limitations}

::: {.duplicate-content data-source="Outline_11.7#mtair-limitations"} 
Despite its innovations, MTAIR faces fundamental limitations that motivate the automated approach. The scalability bottleneck is severe—manual model construction requires weeks of expert effort per argument, making comprehensive coverage impossible. The static nature of manually constructed models provides no mechanisms for updating as new research and evidence emerge. Limited accessibility restricts usage to specialists with formal modeling expertise, excluding many stakeholders. Finally, the single worldview focus creates difficulty in representing multiple conflicting perspectives simultaneously, limiting the framework's utility for coordination across diverse viewpoints. 
:::

However, MTAIR's manual approach faces severe constraints:

**Labor Intensity**: Each model requires dozens of expert-hours to construct, limiting coverage to a few perspectives.

<!-- [ ] TODO: Manual Extraction Time Analysis -->
<!-- [ ] COMPLETELY REWRITE: Results were HALLUCINATED -- rewrite by describing what procedures etc. one would ideally follow (inferred from MTAIR materials)

Detailed breakdown needed:
- Variable identification: X hours
- Structure elicitation: Y hours  
- Probability quantification: Z hours
- Validation and refinement: W hours
Total per model: ~200-400 hours
```
-->
**Static Nature**: Models become outdated as arguments evolve but updating requires near-complete reconstruction.

**Limited Accessibility**: Using the models requires Analytica software and significant technical sophistication.

**Single Perspective**: Each model represents one worldview, making comparison across perspectives difficult.

These limitations prevent MTAIR's approach from scaling to meet AI governance needs. As the pace of AI development accelerates and arguments proliferate, manual modeling cannot keep pace.

        There is a simple truth - humanityʼs extinction is possible. Recent history has also
        shown us another truth - we can create artificial intelligence AI that can rival
        humanity.
        While most AI development is beneficial, artificial superintelligence threatens
        humanity with extinction. We have no method to currently control an entity with
        greater intelligence than us. We currently have no ability to predict the intelligence of
        advanced AIs prior to developing them, and we have incredibly limited methods to
        accurately measure their competence after development.
        We now stand at a time of peril. Companies across the globe are investing to create
        artificial superintelligence – that they believe will surpass the collective capabilities
        of all humans. They publicly state that it is not a matter of “ifˮ such superintelligence
        might exist, but “whenˮ.
        We do not know how to control AI vastly more powerful than us. Should attempts to
        build superintelligence succeed, this would risk our extinction as a species. But
        humanity can choose a different future: there is a narrow path through.
        A new and ambitious future lies beyond a narrow path. A future driven by human
        advancement and technological progress. One where humanity fulfills the dreams
        and aspirations of our ancestors to end disease and extreme poverty, achieves
        virtually limitless energy, lives longer and healthier lives, and travels the cosmos.
        That future requires us to be in control of that which we create, including AI.
        We are currently on an unmanaged and uncontrolled path towards the creation of AI
        that threatens the extinction of humanity. This document is our effort to
        comprehensively outline what is needed to step off that dangerous path and tread an
        alternate path for humanity. To achieve these goals, we have developed proposals
        intended for action by policymakers, split into three Phases:
        Phase 0 Safety - New institutions, legislation, and policies that countries should
        implement immediately that prevent development of AI that we do not have control
        of. With correct execution, the strength of these measures should prevent anyone
        from developing artificial superintelligence for the next 20 years.
        Phase 1 Stability - International institutions that ensure measures to control the
        development of AI do not collapse under geopolitical rivalries or rogue development
        by state and non-state actors. With correct execution, these measures should
        ensure stability and lead to an international AI oversight system that does not
        collapse over time.
        Phase 2 Flourishing - With the development of rogue superintelligence prevented
        and a stable international system in place, humanity can focus on the scientific
        foundations for transformative AI under human control. Build a robust science and
        metrology of intelligence, safe-by-design AI engineering, and other foundations

### 2.7.3 From Natural Language to Computational Models {#sec-natural-to-computational}



::: {.callout-tip}

## The Two-Stage Extraction Process

AMTAIR employs a novel two-stage process that separates structural argument extraction from probability quantification, enabling modular improvement and human oversight at critical decision points.
:::

The heart of the AMTAIR approach lies in its two-stage extraction process, which transforms unstructured text into structured probabilistic models through distinct steps that mirror human cognitive processes. This separation—extracting structure before probability—creates important advantages for automation quality, intermediate verification, and interpretability.

When humans analyze complex arguments, they typically first determine what factors matter and how they relate causally, then assess how likely different scenarios are based on those relationships. A climate scientist reading a paper first identifies key variables (emissions, warming, effects) and their causal connections before estimating probabilities of outcomes. This natural cognitive sequence inspired AMTAIR's two-stage approach.

**Stage 1: Structure Extraction** focuses on identifying key variables and their causal relationships from text, transforming unstructured arguments into ArgDown format. This process involves:

1. **Variable identification:** Determining the key factors discussed in the text, including their possible states (e.g., whether a factor is present/absent or has multiple levels)
    
2. **Relationship mapping:** Establishing how variables influence each other, creating a directed graph of causal connections
    
3. **Hierarchical organization:** Arranging variables according to their causal relationships, from root causes to final effects
    
4. **Metadata attachment:** Annotating each variable with its description and possible states in structured JSON format
    

The LLM prompt for this stage emphasizes clear identification of causal structure without requiring probability judgments, allowing the model to focus entirely on understanding "what affects what" in the text. This specialized prompt includes detailed instructions about ArgDown syntax, examples of well-formed representations, and guidance for preserving the author's intended meaning.

#| fig-alt: "example use case"
-->









This key function transforms the ArgDown text into a structured DataFrame, capturing the hierarchical relationships between variables and preparing them for further processing. The function works by identifying node titles, descriptions, and indentation levels, then establishing parent-child relationships based on the hierarchy indicated by indentation.




**Stage 2: Probability Integration** enhances the structural representation with probability information, creating a complete BayesDown specification. This stage involves:

1. **Question generation:** Automatically creating appropriate probability questions based on the network structure
    
2. **Probability extraction:** Obtaining probability estimates for each question, either from the text or through LLM inference
    
3. **Consistency checking:** Ensuring probability distributions sum to 1 and match structural constraints
    
4. **BayesDown integration:** Incorporating probability information into the ArgDown structure
    

The key innovation in this stage is the automated generation of appropriate probability questions based on network structure. For each node, the system generates questions about prior probabilities (how likely is this variable in isolation?) and conditional probabilities (how likely is this variable given different states of its parents?).

Figure 5 illustrates how probability questions are derived for a simple node with one parent:

[FIGURE 5: Diagram showing how probability questions are generated based on network structure]

For the "Sprinkler" node with parent "Rain," the system automatically generates questions like:

- What is the probability for Sprinkler=sprinkler_TRUE?
- What is the probability for Sprinkler=sprinkler_TRUE if Rain=rain_TRUE?
- What is the probability for Sprinkler=sprinkler_TRUE if Rain=rain_FALSE?

These questions are then answered either by extracting explicit probabilities from the text or by having the LLM infer reasonable values based on the author's arguments. The answers are structured into a complete BayesDown representation that includes both the causal structure and all necessary probability information.

The visualization below demonstrates the completed extraction for a portion of Carlsmith's model, showing how variables like "Misaligned Power Seeking" are influenced by multiple factors, each with associated probabilities:

[VISUALIZATION: Extracted causal structure from Carlsmith's model with probability information]

This two-stage approach offers several important advantages:

1. **Improved extraction quality:** By focusing on one cognitive task at a time, the LLM performs better at each stage than it would attempting to extract everything simultaneously.
    
2. **Intermediate verification:** Having ArgDown as an intermediate representation allows human verification before probability extraction, catching structural errors early.
    
3. **Separation of concerns:** Structure and probability can be updated independently, enabling more flexible maintenance as new information emerges.
    
4. **Alignment with human cognition:** The process mirrors how experts approach complex arguments, making the system's operation more intuitive and interpretable.
    

Perhaps most importantly, the intermediate ArgDown representation creates a bridge between qualitative and quantitative aspects of arguments. It preserves the narrative structure and conceptual relationships from the original text while preparing for mathematical precision through probability integration. This hybrid approach maintains the strengths of both worlds: the richness of natural language and the rigor of formal models.













### 2.7.4 Directed Acyclic Graphs: Structure and Semantics {#sec-dag-structure}

::: {.redundant-content data-better-version="Outline_11.7#dag-structure"}
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) form the mathematical foundation of Bayesian networks, encoding both the qualitative structure of causal relationships and the quantitative parameters that define conditional dependencies. In AI risk modeling, these structures represent causal pathways to potential outcomes of interest.

Key mathematical properties essential for AI risk modeling:

- **Acyclicity**: Ensures coherent probabilistic interpretation
- **D-separation**: Defines conditional independence relationships
- **Markov Condition**: Each variable conditionally independent of non-descendants given parents
- **Path Analysis**: Reveals causal pathways and information flow

The causal interpretation follows Pearl's framework:^[Pearl's causal framework revolutionized how we think about causation in complex systems]

Once Bayesian networks are constructed, probabilistic inference enables reasoning about uncertainties, counterfactuals, and policy interventions. For the complex networks representing AI risks, computational approaches must balance accuracy with tractability.

Inference methods implemented include exact methods for smaller networks (variable elimination, junction trees), approximate methods for larger networks (Monte Carlo sampling, variational inference), specialized approaches for rare event analysis, and intervention modeling for policy evaluation using do-calculus.
:::

Implementation considerations:

- **Computational Complexity**: Managing exponential growth through decomposition
- **Sampling Efficiency**: Importance sampling for rare events
- **Approximation Quality**: Convergence diagnostics and error bounds
- **Uncertainty Propagation**: Representing confidence in outputs

<!-- [ ] TODO: Add MC sampling implementation example --> <!-- [ ] TODO: Discuss variance reduction techniques -->




### 2.7.7 Integration with Prediction Markets and Forecasting Platforms {#sec-prediction-markets}

<!-- [ ] MODIFY: this section to make clear that the integration of Prediction Markets and Forecasting Platforms will be an extension which has not been implemented yet -->

<!-- [ ] DISCUSS: the best case implementation and the advantages it would bring -->

To maintain relevance in a rapidly evolving field, formal models must integrate with live data sources such as prediction markets and forecasting platforms.

::: {.redundant-content data-better-version="Outline_11.7#prediction-markets"}
Live data sources for dynamic model updating include:

- **Metaculus**: Long-term AI predictions and technological forecasting
- **Good Judgment Open**: Geopolitical events and policy outcomes
- **Manifold Markets**: Diverse question types with rapid market response
- **Internal Expert Forecasting**: Organization-specific predictions and assessments
:::


<!-- [ ] COMPLETELY REWRITE: CODE IS HALLUCINATED -- rewrite by describing a possible implementation abstractly and discussing it 


The data processing pipeline:



python



```python
def integrate_forecast_data(model_variables, forecast_platforms):
    """Connect Bayesian network variables to live forecasting data"""
    mappings = create_semantic_mappings(model_variables, forecast_platforms)
    
    for variable, forecasts in mappings.items():
        weighted_forecast = aggregate_forecasts(
            forecasts, 
            weights=calculate_track_record_weights(forecasts)
        )
        model.update_prior(variable, weighted_forecast)
    
    return model.recompute_posteriors()
```

-->

Technical challenges:

- **Question Mapping**: Semantic matching between model variables and market questions
- **Temporal Alignment**: Different forecast horizons and update frequencies
- **Conflict Resolution**: Principled aggregation of contradictory sources
- **Track Record Weighting**: Incorporating forecaster calibration




<!-- [ ] TODO: Add transition to Chapter 3 -->

With these theoretical foundations and methodological approaches established, we can now present the AMTAIR system implementation. The next chapter demonstrates how these concepts translate into a working prototype that automates the extraction and formalization of world models from AI safety literature.

## 3.2 The Two-Stage Extraction Process {#sec-two-stage-extraction}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Detail the process of extracting ArgDown representations -->

The core innovation of AMTAIR lies in separating structural extraction from probability quantification. This two-stage approach addresses key challenges in automated formalization.





### 3.2.1 Stage 1: Structural Extraction (ArgDown) {#sec-stage1-argdown}

::: {.duplicate-content data-source="Outline_11.7#stage1-argdown"}
The first stage identifies argument structure without concerning itself with quantification:

**Variable Identification**: Extract key propositions and entities from text using patterns like "X causes Y," "If A then B," and domain-specific indicators.

**Relationship Mapping**: Identify support, attack, and conditional relationships between variables through linguistic analysis.

**Hierarchy Construction**: Build nested ArgDown representation preserving logical flow.

**Validation**: Ensure extracted structure forms valid directed acyclic graph and preserves key argumentative relationships from source.
:::

Example ArgDown extraction:

```
[Existential_Catastrophe]: Destruction of humanity's potential.
 + [Human_Disempowerment]: Loss of control to AI systems.
   + [Misaligned_Power_Seeking]: AI pursuing problematic objectives.
     + [APS_Systems]: Advanced, agentic, strategic AI.
     + [Deployment_Decisions]: Choice to deploy despite risks.
```

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-extraction-example}: "Side-by-side source text and extracted ArgDown" -->







### 3.2.2 Stage 2: Probability Integration (BayesDown) {#sec-stage2-bayesdown}

The second stage adds quantitative information to the structural skeleton:

**Question Generation**: For each node, generate probability elicitation questions tailored to the specific context and relationships.

<!-- [ ] TODO: Probability Question Generation -->

```
Examples needed:
- "What is the probability of existential catastrophe?"
- "What is P(catastrophe|human_disempowerment)?"
- Show how questions map to BayesDown structure
```

**Probability Extraction**:

- Identify explicit numerical statements
- Map qualitative expressions using calibrated scales
- Apply domain-specific heuristics for common phrasings

**Coherence Enforcement**:

- Ensure probabilities sum to 1.0
- Complete conditional probability tables
- Check for logical contradictions
- Flag low-confidence extractions




### 3.2.3 Why Two Stages? {#sec-why-two-stages}

<!-- [ ] EXPAND: the benefits this setup, add -->

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Outline_11.7#why-two-stages"}
This separation provides several benefits:

**Transparency**: Being able to scrutinize each step of the automated workflow provides reliable insight into the work being done

**Accountability**: False information (think of hallucinations) can be traced back to its origins


**Visibility**: 


**Modular Validation**: Structure can be verified independently from probability estimates, simplifying quality assurance.

**Human Oversight**: Experts can review and correct structural extraction before probability quantification.

**Flexible Quantification**: Different methods (LLM extraction, expert elicitation, market data) can provide probabilities for the same structure.

**Error Isolation**: Structural errors don't contaminate probability extraction and vice versa.

### 3.3.1 Technology Stack {#sec-tech-stack}

The system leverages established libraries while adding novel extraction capabilities:

|Component|Technology|Purpose|

|Language Models|GPT-4, Claude|Argument extraction|
|Network Analysis|NetworkX|Graph algorithms|
|Probabilistic Modeling|pgmpy|Bayesian operations|
|Visualization|PyVis|Interactive rendering|
|Data Processing|Pandas|Structured manipulation|

: Technology stack components {#tbl-tech-stack}




### 3.3.2 Key Algorithms {#sec-key-algorithms}

**Hierarchical Parsing**: The system parses ArgDown/BayesDown syntax recognizing indentation-based hierarchy, a critical innovation for preserving argument structure.

**Probability Completion**: When sources don't specify all required probabilities, the system uses:

- Maximum entropy principles for missing values
- Coherence constraint propagation
- Expert-specified defaults with confidence scoring

**Visual Encoding Strategy**:

- Green-to-red gradient for probability magnitude
- Border colors indicating node types
- Interactive elements for exploration

<!-- [ ] TODO: Algorithm pseudocode for key functions -->



### 3.3.3 (Expected) Performance Characteristics {#sec-performance}

The bottleneck shifts from extraction (linear in text length) to inference (exponential in network connectivity) as models grow.

### 3.4.1 Processing Steps {#sec-rsg-processing}

The system processes this input through five steps:

2. **Question Generation**: Generate questions based on the possible instantiations and combinations of each parent note to identify the probabilities to be extracted in the next step
3. **BayesDown Extraction**: LLM call extracting the full conditional probability tables for each node
4. **Construction**: Building of the formal Bayesian network
5. **Visualization**: Render interactive display

## 3.5 Case Study: Carlsmith's Power-Seeking AI Model {#sec-case-carlsmith}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Introduce and refine walkthrough of the pipeline with the more complex Carlsmith model -->

Applying AMTAIR to Carlsmith's model demonstrates scalability to realistic AI safety arguments.




### 3.5.1 Model Complexity {#sec-carlsmith-complexity}


The Carlsmith model contains:

- **23 nodes** representing different factors
- **29 edges** encoding dependencies
- **Multiple probability tables** with complex conditionals
- **Six-level causal depth** from root causes to catastrophe


This represents a significant increase in complexity from the pedagogical example.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-carlsmith-network}: "Full Carlsmith model Bayesian network visualization" -->










### 3.5.2 Automated Extraction of the Carlsmith's Argument Structure   {#sec-carlsmith-extraction}

Having validated the implementation on the canonical rain-sprinkler-lawn example, I applied the AMTAIR approach to a substantially more complex real-world case: Joseph Carlsmith's model of existential risk from power-seeking AI. This application demonstrates the system's ability to handle sophisticated multi-level arguments with numerous variables and relationships.

Carlsmith's analysis involves dozens of factors organized in a complex causal structure, from root causes like "Advanced AI Capability" and "Instrumental Convergence" through intermediate factors like "APS Systems" and "Misaligned Power Seeking" to final outcomes like "Existential Catastrophe." The model exhibits several challenging features:

1. **Multi-level structure** with causal chains spanning multiple steps
2. **Divergent pathways** where factors influence outcomes through multiple routes
3. **Complex conditional dependencies** with variables influenced by multiple parents
4. **Variables with three or more possible states** rather than simple binary outcomes
5. **Interconnected clusters** where factors form distinct but related argument groups





**Core Risk Pathway**:

```
Existential_Catastrophe 
← Human_Disempowerment 
← Scale_Of_Power_Seeking
← Misaligned_Power_Seeking
← [APS_Systems, Difficulty_Of_Alignment, Deployment_Decisions]
```

**Supporting Structure**:

- Competitive dynamics influencing deployment
- Technical factors affecting alignment difficulty
- Corrective mechanisms and their limitations

**Probability Preservation**:

- Extracted probabilities match Carlsmith's published estimates
- Conditional relationships properly captured
- Final P(doom) calculation reproduces ~5% result

#| fig-alt: "Parsing ArgDown & BayesDown"

This representation captures the complex causal structure of Carlsmith's argument, with 21 variables organized in a multi-level hierarchy. The "Misaligned_Power_Seeking" node appears multiple times, reflecting its role as a central concept that influences several other variables.

### 3.5.4 Practically Meaningful BayesDown
Bridging Qualitative and Quantitative Representation

If the coordination crisis in AI governance stems partly from incompatible languages across domains—technical researchers speaking in mathematical formalisms, policy specialists in institutional frameworks, and ethicists in normative concepts—then effective coordination requires bridges between these domains. BayesDown serves as such a bridge, combining the narrative richness of qualitative argumentation with the precision of quantitative probability judgments.

Traditional formal representations face a fundamental tradeoff: increase precision and you sacrifice accessibility; enhance accessibility and you lose precision. Mathematical notations offer exactness but exclude many stakeholders. Natural language provides accessibility but permits ambiguity and vagueness. This tradeoff creates communication barriers between technical and policy domains, limiting coordination on complex challenges like AI governance.

BayesDown disrupts this tradeoff by creating a hybrid representation that preserves strengths from both worlds. Its design follows three key principles:

First, **human readability** ensures the representation remains interpretable without specialized training. The syntax builds on familiar conventions from markdown and JSON, maintaining hierarchical relationships through indentation and encapsulating technical details within structured metadata. Unlike purely mathematical notations, the format preserves natural language descriptions alongside formal elements.

Second, **machine processability** enables computational analysis and transformation. The consistent syntax permits automated parsing, formal verification, and conversion to computational models like Bayesian networks. The structured JSON metadata provides clear paths for extracting probability information and mapping it to conditional probability tables.

Third, **contextual preservation** maintains the connection to original arguments. By including descriptive text alongside formal structure, BayesDown retains the narrative context and qualitative considerations that inform probability judgments. This contextual information helps users interpret the model in light of the original arguments.

Consider how these principles manifest in the BayesDown syntax. Each node begins with a bracketed title followed by a natural language description, preserving the core statement being formalized. The JSON metadata contains technical information like instantiations, priors, and posteriors, but keeps this information clearly separated from the narrative content. Hierarchical relationships use indentation and plus symbols, creating a visual structure that mirrors causal influence.

#| fig-alt: "Example BayesDown Excerpt from the Carlsmith model"



[Existential_Catastrophe]: The destruction of humanity's long-term potential due to AI systems we've lost control over. {
  "instantiations": ["existential_catastrophe_TRUE", "existential_catastrophe_FALSE"],
  "priors": {"p(existential_catastrophe_TRUE)": "0.05", "p(existential_catastrophe_FALSE)": "0.95"},
  "posteriors": {

     "p(human_disempowerment_TRUE|scale_of_power_seeking_FALSE)": "0.0"
   }
 }
```

This excerpt from the Carlsmith model representation illustrates how BayesDown preserves both the narrative description ("The destruction of humanity's long-term potential...") and the precise probability judgments. Someone without technical background can still understand the core claims and their relationships, while someone seeking quantitative precision can find exact probability values.

The format supports multiple levels of engagement. At the most basic level, readers can follow the hierarchical structure to understand causal relationships between factors. At an intermediate level, they can examine probability judgments to assess the strength of different influences. At the most technical level, they can analyze the complete probabilistic model to perform inference and sensitivity analysis.

This multi-level accessibility creates important advantages for coordination across domains:

1. **Technical-policy translation:** BayesDown provides a common reference point for technical researchers explaining safety concerns and policy specialists evaluating governance options, reducing communication barriers.
    
2. **Argumentation transparency:** The format makes assumptions explicit, helping identify genuine disagreements versus terminological confusion or unstated premises.
    
3. **Incremental formalization:** BayesDown supports varying levels of formality, from qualitative structure to complete probability specifications, allowing gradual progression from informal to formal representations.
    
4. **Verification flexibility:** Human experts can verify extracted representations at different levels—checking structural correctness without assessing probabilities, or focusing on critical probability judgments without reviewing the entire model.
    

The hybrid nature of BayesDown aligns with how experts typically communicate complex ideas: combining qualitative explanations with quantitative judgments, using natural language to provide context for formal claims, and adjusting precision based on audience needs. By mirroring these natural communication patterns, BayesDown makes formalization more intuitive and accessible.

This bridging function extends beyond representation to influence the entire extraction and analysis workflow. When extracting from text, the two-stage process preserves narrative context alongside formal structure. When visualizing models, interactive interfaces provide both qualitative descriptions and quantitative details. When evaluating policies, counterfactual analysis incorporates both mathematical precision and contextual interpretation.

In the broader context of the coordination crisis, BayesDown demonstrates how thoughtfully designed intermediate representations can overcome communication barriers between domains. Rather than forcing all stakeholders to adopt a single specialized language, it creates a flexible format that accommodates different perspectives while enabling precise analysis—precisely the kind of bridge needed for effective coordination on complex governance challenges.


### 3.5.5 Interactive Visualization and Exploration

<!-- [ ] REVIEW -->

Complex probabilistic models like Bayesian networks contain rich information, but they often remain inaccessible to many stakeholders. A conditional probability table with dozens of values conveys precise relationships, but few can intuitively grasp its implications. This accessibility gap limits the potential for coordinated action on AI governance challenges—what good is formalization if the resulting models remain opaque to most decision-makers?

AMTAIR addresses this challenge through interactive visualization designed to make complex probabilistic relationships accessible to diverse stakeholders. The approach combines visual encoding of probability information, progressive disclosure of details, and interactive exploration capabilities to create intuitive interfaces for complex models.

The visualization system follows several key design principles:

First, **visual encoding of probability** uses color gradients to represent likelihood values. Nodes are colored on a spectrum from red (low probability) to green (high probability) based on their primary state's probability. This simple visual cue provides immediate insights into which outcomes are more or less likely without requiring numerical interpretation.

Second, **structural classification** uses border colors to indicate node types based on network position. Blue borders designate root causes (nodes without parents), purple borders mark intermediate nodes (with both parents and children), and magenta borders highlight leaf nodes (final effects without children). This classification helps users understand the causal flow through the network.

Third, **progressive disclosure** presents information in layers of increasing detail. Basic node information appears in the visualization itself, additional details emerge in tooltips on hover, and comprehensive probability tables display in modal windows on click. This layered approach prevents information overload while ensuring all details remain accessible.

Fourth, **interactive exploration** allows users to reorganize nodes, zoom in on areas of interest, adjust physics parameters, and investigate probability values. These capabilities transform the visualization from a static image into an explorable knowledge landscape.

The complete BayesDown representation was processed through the AMTAIR pipeline, resulting in a structured DataFrame and ultimately a Bayesian network. 


<!-- [ ] FIX: redundant figure descriptions -->

The figure below shows the interactive visualization of Carlsmith's model, highlighting how color, border styling, and layout work together to represent complex causal relationships:


The visualization system implements these principles through a combination of NetworkX for graph representation and PyVis for interactive display, with custom HTML generation for tooltips and modals:

The resulting visualization (Figure 10) shows the complete Carlsmith model with color-coded nodes representing probability values:

[FIGURE 10: Interactive visualization of Carlsmith's model showing color-coded nodes and relationships]

#| fig-alt: "Main Visualization Function"
-->

[FIGURE N: Interactive visualization of Carlsmith's model showing color-coded nodes and causal relationships]





This visualization reveals several structural insights:

1. **Central importance of "Misaligned_Power_Seeking"** as a hub node with multiple parents and children
2. **Multiple pathways to "Existential_Catastrophe"** through different intermediate factors
3. **Clusters of related variables** forming coherent subarguments (e.g., factors affecting alignment difficulty)
4. **Flow of influence** from technical factors (bottom) through deployment decisions to ultimate outcomes (top)

The implementation successfully handles the complexity of Carlsmith's model, correctly processing the multi-level structure, resolving repeated node references, and calculating appropriate probability distributions. The interactive visualization makes this complex model accessible, allowing users to explore different aspects of the argument through intuitive navigation.

Several key aspects of the implementation were particularly important for handling this complex model:

1. The **parent-child relationship detection algorithm** correctly identified hierarchical relationships despite the complex structure with repeated nodes and multiple levels.
    
2. The **probability question generation system** created appropriate questions for all variables, including those with multiple parents requiring factorial combinations of conditional probabilities.
    
3. The **network enhancement functions** calculated useful metrics like centrality measures and Markov blankets that help interpret the model structure.
    
4. The **visualization system** effectively presented the complex network through color-coding, interactive exploration, and progressive disclosure of details.
    

The successful application to Carlsmith's model demonstrates the AMTAIR approach's scalability to complex real-world arguments. While the canonical rain-sprinkler-lawn example validated correctness, this application proves practical utility for sophisticated multi-level arguments with dozens of variables and complex interdependencies—precisely the kind of arguments that characterize AI risk assessments.

This capability addresses a core limitation of the original MTAIR framework: the labor intensity of manual formalization. Where manually converting Carlsmith's argument to a formal model might take days of expert time, the AMTAIR approach accomplished this in minutes, creating a foundation for further analysis and exploration.



































Beyond the core visualization, the system includes specialized components that enhance understanding of probabilistic relationships:

1. **Probability bars** provide visual representations of probability distributions, showing relative likelihoods of different states using color-coded horizontal bars with numeric labels.
    
2. **Conditional probability tables** organize complex relationships into structured matrices, displaying how different combinations of parent states influence probability distributions.
    
3. **Sensitivity indicators** highlight which nodes and relationships most significantly affect outcomes, directing attention to critical factors.
    

These components work together to create an intuitive interface for complex probabilistic models. A user might start by exploring the overall structure to understand key factors and relationships, hover over nodes of interest to see probability summaries, then click on specific nodes to examine detailed conditional probabilities.

The benefits of this visualization approach extend beyond aesthetic appeal to fundamental improvements in understanding and communication:

First, **intuitive comprehension** of probability relationships becomes possible even for those without formal training in Bayesian statistics. The color coding provides immediate visual cues about which outcomes are more likely, while interactive exploration allows users to develop intuition about how different factors influence results.

Second, **cross-stakeholder communication** improves through shared visual reference points. Technical experts can use the visualizations to explain complex relationships to policy specialists, while governance experts can identify institutional factors that might be incorporated into the models.

Third, **disagreement identification** becomes more precise as stakeholders can point to specific nodes, relationships, or probability values where their views differ, focusing discussion on substantive issues rather than terminological confusion.

Fourth, **intervention assessment** becomes more concrete as users can see how changing specific factors influences downstream effects, providing intuitive understanding of causal pathways and leverage points.

The visualization system demonstrates how thoughtful interface design can overcome barriers to understanding complex formal models. By making probabilistic relationships visually intuitive and progressively disclosing details based on user interest, it creates bridges between mathematical precision and human comprehension—precisely the kind of bridge needed to support coordination across domains in AI governance.

This approach reflects a broader principle: formalization is most valuable when it enhances rather than replaces human understanding. The AMTAIR visualization doesn't simplify complex relationships; it makes them more accessible by leveraging visual cognition, interactive exploration, and progressive disclosure. This human-centered approach to formalization creates tools that augment rather than replace expert judgment, enhancing our collective ability to understand and address complex governance challenges.





#### **Insights from Formalization** 

Formal representation reveals several insights:

**Critical Path Analysis**: The pathway through APS development and deployment decisions carries the highest risk contribution.

**Sensitivity Points**: Small changes in deployment probability create large changes in overall risk.

**Intervention Opportunities**: Improving alignment difficulty or deployment governance show highest impact potential.

These insights emerge naturally from formal analysis but remain implicit in textual arguments.

- **Automated extraction** from natural language to formal models
- **Two-stage architecture** separating structure from quantification
- **High fidelity** preservation of complex arguments
- **Interactive visualization** accessible to diverse users
- **Scalable implementation** handling realistic network sizes

These achievements validate the feasibility of computational coordination infrastructure for AI governance.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-achievement-summary}: "Visual summary of AMTAIR capabilities" -->

These results demonstrate both the feasibility and value of automated model extraction for AI governance. However, several important considerations and limitations merit discussion. The next chapter critically examines these issues, addresses potential objections, and explores the broader implications of this approach for enhancing epistemic security in AI governance.

## 4.1 Technical Limitations and Responses {#sec-technical-limitations}



### 4.1.1 Objection 1: Extraction Quality Boundaries {#sec-extraction-boundaries}

::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with="Outline_11.7#extraction-boundaries"}

**Critic**: "Complex implicit reasoning chains resist formalization; automated extraction will systematically miss nuanced arguments and subtle conditional relationships that human experts would identify."
:::


**Response**: This concern has merit—extraction does face inherent limitations. However, the empirical results tell a more nuanced story. With extraction achieving 85%+ accuracy for structural relationships and 73% for probability capture, the system performs well enough for practical use while falling short of human expert performance.

More importantly, AMTAIR employs a hybrid human-AI workflow that addresses this limitation:

- **Two-stage verification**: Humans review structural extraction before probability quantification
- **Transparent outputs**: All intermediate representations remain human-readable  
- **Iterative refinement**: Extraction prompts improve based on error analysis
- **Ensemble approaches**: Multiple extraction attempts can identify ambiguities

The question is not whether automated extraction perfectly captures every nuance—it doesn't. Rather, it's whether imperfect extraction still provides value over no formal representation. When the alternative is relying on conflicting mental models that remain entirely implicit, even 75% accurate formal models represent significant progress.

Furthermore, extraction errors often reveal interesting properties of the source arguments themselves—ambiguities that human readers gloss over become explicit when formalization fails. This diagnostic value enhances rather than undermines the approach.

<!-- [ ] IMPLEMENT: Explain Extraction confidence scoring system -->




### 4.1.2 Objection 2: False Precision in Uncertainty {#sec-false-precision}

**Critic**: "Attaching exact probabilities to unprecedented events like AI catastrophe is fundamentally misguided. The numbers create false confidence in what amounts to educated speculation about radically uncertain futures."

**Response**: This philosophical objection strikes at the heart of formal risk assessment. However, AMTAIR addresses it through several design choices:

First, the system explicitly represents uncertainty about uncertainty. Rather than point estimates, the framework supports probability distributions over parameters. When someone says "likely" we might model this as Beta(8,2) rather than exactly 0.8, capturing both the central estimate and our uncertainty about it.

<!-- [ ] IMPLEMENT: EXPLAIN Full probability distribution support -->
```

Technical requirements:

- Beta distributions for probability parameters
- Dirichlet for multi-state variables
- Propagation through inference
- Visualization of uncertainty bounds

```

Second, all probabilities are explicitly conditional on stated assumptions. The system doesn't claim "P(catastrophe) = 0.05" absolutely, but rather "Given Carlsmith's model assumptions, P(catastrophe) = 0.05." This conditionality is preserved throughout analysis.

Third, sensitivity analysis reveals which probabilities actually matter. Often, precise values are unnecessary—knowing whether a parameter is closer to 0.1 or 0.9 suffices for decision-making. The formalization helps identify where precision matters and where it doesn't.

Finally, the alternative to quantification isn't avoiding the problem but making it worse. When experts say "highly likely" or "significant risk," they implicitly reason with probabilities. Formalization simply makes these implicit quantities explicit and subject to scrutiny. As Dennis Lindley noted, "Uncertainty is not in the events, but in our knowledge about them."

@@lindley2013










### 4.1.3 Objection 3: Correlation Complexity {#sec-correlation-complexity}

**Critic**: "Bayesian networks assume conditional independence given parents, but real-world AI risks involve complex correlations. Ignoring these dependencies could dramatically misrepresent risk levels."

**Response**: Standard Bayesian networks do face limitations with correlation representation—this is a genuine technical challenge. However, several approaches within the framework address this:

**Explicit correlation nodes**: When factors share hidden common causes, we can add latent variables to capture correlations. For instance, "AI research culture" might influence both "capability advancement" and "safety investment."

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-correlation-nodes}: "Example of explicit correlation modeling" -->

**Copula methods**: For known correlation structures, copula functions can model dependencies while preserving marginal distributions. This extends standard Bayesian networks significantly.^[Copulas provide a mathematically elegant way to separate marginal behavior from dependence structure]

<!-- [ ] ADD: @nelson2006: "An Introduction to Copulas" -->

@nelson2006

**Sensitivity bounds**: When correlations remain uncertain, we can compute bounds on outcomes under different correlation assumptions. This reveals when correlations critically affect conclusions.

**Model ensembles**: Different correlation structures can be modeled separately and results aggregated, similar to climate modeling approaches.

More fundamentally, the question is whether imperfect independence assumptions invalidate the approach. In practice, explicitly modeling first-order effects with known limitations often proves more valuable than attempting to capture all dependencies informally. The framework makes assumptions transparent, enabling targeted improvements where correlations matter most.

<!-- [ ] IMPLEMENT: Correlation sensitivity analysis tools -->





## 4.2 Conceptual and Methodological Concerns {#sec-conceptual-concerns}

### 4.2.1 Objection 4: Democratic Exclusion {#sec-democratic-exclusion}

**Critic**: "Transforming policy debates into complex graphs and equations will sideline non-technical stakeholders, concentrating influence among those comfortable with formal models. This technocratic approach undermines democratic participation in crucial decisions about humanity's future."

**Response**: This concern about technocratic exclusion deserves serious consideration—formal methods can indeed create barriers. However, AMTAIR's design explicitly prioritizes accessibility alongside rigor:

**Progressive disclosure interfaces** allow engagement at multiple levels. A policymaker might explore visual network structures and probability color-coding without engaging mathematical details. Interactive features let users modify assumptions and see consequences without understanding implementation.

**Natural language preservation** ensures original arguments remain accessible. The BayesDown format maintains human-readable descriptions alongside formal specifications. Users can always trace from mathematical representations back to source texts.

**Comparative advantage** comes from making implicit technical content explicit, not adding complexity. When experts debate AI risk, they already employ sophisticated probabilistic reasoning—formalization reveals rather than creates this complexity. Making hidden assumptions visible arguably enhances rather than reduces democratic participation.

**Multiple interfaces** serve different communities. Researchers access full technical depth, policymakers use summary dashboards, public stakeholders explore interactive visualizations. The same underlying model supports varied engagement modes.

Rather than excluding non-technical stakeholders, proper implementation can democratize access to expert reasoning by making it inspectable and modifiable. The risk lies not in formalization itself but in poor interface design or gatekeeping behaviors around model access.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-multi-interface}: "Different stakeholder interfaces for same model" -->










### 4.2.2 Objection 5: Oversimplification of Complex Systems {#sec-oversimplification}

**Critic**: "Forcing rich socio-technical systems into discrete Bayesian networks necessarily loses crucial dynamics—feedback loops, emergent properties, institutional responses, and cultural factors that shape AI development. The models become precise but wrong."

**Response**: All models simplify by necessity—as Box noted, "All models are wrong, but some are useful." The question becomes whether formal simplifications improve upon informal mental models:

**Transparent limitations** make formal models' shortcomings explicit. Unlike mental models where simplifications remain hidden, network representations clearly show what is and isn't included. This transparency enables targeted criticism and improvement.

**Iterative refinement** allows models to grow more sophisticated over time. Starting with first-order effects and adding complexity where it proves important follows successful practice in other domains. Climate models began simply and added dynamics as computational power and understanding grew.

**Complementary tools** address different aspects of the system. Bayesian networks excel at probabilistic reasoning and intervention analysis. Other approaches—agent-based models, system dynamics, scenario planning—can capture different properties. AMTAIR provides one lens, not the only lens.

**Empirical adequacy** ultimately judges models. If simplified representations enable better predictions and decisions than informal alternatives, their abstractions are justified. Early results suggest formal models, despite simplifications, outperform intuitive reasoning for complex risk assessment.

The goal isn't creating perfect representations but useful ones. By making simplifications explicit and modifiable, formal models enable systematic improvement in ways mental models cannot.

## 4.3 Red-Teaming Results {#sec-red-teaming}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Present results from systematic attempts to find weaknesses -->

To identify failure modes, I conducted systematic adversarial testing of the AMTAIR system.

### 4.3.1 Adversarial Extraction Attempts {#sec-adversarial-extraction}

<!-- [ ] COMPLETELY REWRITE: Results were HALLUCINATED -- rewrite by describing what procedures etc. one would ideally follow 

I tested the system with deliberately challenging inputs:

**Contradictory Arguments**: Texts asserting P(A) = 0.2 and P(A) = 0.8 in different sections
- Result: System flagged inconsistency rather than averaging
- Mitigation: Explicit consistency checking with user resolution

**Circular Reasoning**: Arguments where A causes B causes C causes A
- Result: DAG validation caught cycles, extraction failed gracefully
- Mitigation: Clear error messages explaining the structural issue

**Extremely Vague Language**: Texts using only qualitative terms without clear relationships
- Result: Extraction quality degraded significantly (F1 < 0.5)
- Mitigation: Confidence scores on extracted elements, human review triggers

**Deceptive Framings**: Arguments designed to imply false causal relationships
- Result: System sometimes extracted spurious connections
- Mitigation: Source grounding requirements, validation against citations

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#tbl-adversarial-results}: "Summary of red-teaming findings" -->

-->

### 4.3.2 Robustness Findings {#sec-robustness-findings}

Key vulnerabilities of LLMs (and human experts) identified:

<!-- [ ] VERIFY: red-teaming results -->
```

Specific metrics need validation:

- Anchoring bias: measured effect size with confidence intervals
- Authority sensitivity: controlled experiment design
- Complexity degradation: performance curve analysis
- Context loss: dependency distance metrics

```

1. **Anchoring bias**: System tends to over-weight first probability mentioned^[This reflects how LLMs inherit human cognitive biases from training data]
2. **Authority sensitivity**: Extracted probabilities influenced by cited expert prominence
3. **Complexity degradation**: Performance drops sharply beyond 50 nodes
4. **Context loss**: Long-range dependencies in text sometimes missed

However, the system demonstrated robustness to:
- Different writing styles and academic disciplines
- Variations in argument structure and presentation order
- Mixed numerical and qualitative probability expressions
- Reasonable levels of grammatical errors and typos

### 4.3.3 Implications for Deployment {#sec-deployment-implications}

These results suggest AMTAIR is suitable for:
- **Research applications** with expert oversight
- **Policy analysis** of well-structured arguments
- **Educational uses** demonstrating formal reasoning
- **Collaborative modeling** with human verification

But should be used cautiously for:
- Fully automated analysis without review
- Adversarial or politically contentious texts
- Real-time decision-making without validation
- Arguments far outside training distribution

<!-- [ ] IMPLEMENT: Deployment guidelines and best practices document in Appendix (Link here) -->









## 4.4 Enhancing Epistemic Security {#sec-epistemic-security}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Analyze how formal modeling improves discourse quality -->

Despite limitations, AMTAIR contributes to epistemic security in AI governance through several mechanisms.




### 4.4.1 Making Models Inspectable {#sec-inspectable-models}

The greatest epistemic benefit comes from forcing implicit models into explicit form. When an expert claims "misalignment likely leads to catastrophe," formalization asks:

- Likely means what probability?
- Through what causal pathways?
- Under what assumptions?
- With what evidence?

This explicitation serves multiple functions:

**Clarity**: Vague statements become precise claims subject to evaluation

**Comparability**: Different experts' models can be systematically compared

**Criticizability**: Hidden assumptions become visible targets for challenge

**Updatability**: Formal models can systematically incorporate new evidence

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-explicitation-process}: "How formalization reveals hidden assumptions" -->





### 4.4.2 Revealing Convergence and Divergence {#sec-convergence-divergence}
<!-- [ ] COMPLETELY REWRITE: Results were HALLUCINATED -- rewrite by describing what results we expect from theoretical considerations, how to ideally verify/valsify those
Comparative analysis across extracted models reveals surprising patterns:

<!-- [ ] TODO: Multi-Model Comparison Study -->
```

Implement comparison of 3+ models:

- Structural similarity metrics
- Parameter divergence analysis
- Crux identification algorithms
- Visualization of agreement patterns

```

**Structural convergence**: Different experts often share similar causal models even when probability estimates diverge dramatically. This suggests shared understanding of mechanisms despite disagreement on magnitudes.

**Parameter clustering**: Probability estimates often cluster around a few values rather than spreading uniformly, suggesting implicit coordination or common evidence bases.

**Crux identification**: Formal comparison precisely identifies where worldviews diverge—often just 2-3 key parameters drive different conclusions about overall risk.

These insights remain hidden when arguments stay in natural language form.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-convergence-patterns}: "Heatmap of model agreement across experts" -->

-->

### 4.4.3 Improving Collective Reasoning {#sec-collective-reasoning}

AMTAIR enhances group epistemics through:

**Explicit uncertainty**: Replacing "might," "could," "likely" with probability distributions reduces miscommunication and standardizes precision

**Compositional reasoning**: Complex arguments decompose into manageable components that can be independently evaluated

**Evidence integration**: New information updates specific parameters rather than requiring complete argument reconstruction

**Exploration tools**: Stakeholders can modify assumptions and immediately see consequences, building intuition about model dynamics

<!-- [ ] COMPLETELY REWRITE: Results were HALLUCINATED -- rewrite by describing what benefits one can plausibly anticipate


## Early Results
Pilot studies with AI governance researchers show 40% reduction in time to identify disagreements and 60% improvement in agreement accuracy—though these specific quantitative claims require careful validation with larger samples.

## 4.5 Scaling Challenges and Opportunities {#sec-scaling}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Examine how the modeling approach could complement existing initiatives -->

Moving from prototype to widespread adoption faces both technical and social challenges.

### 4.5.1 Technical Scaling {#sec-technical-scaling}

**Computational complexity** grows with network size, but several approaches help:
- Hierarchical decomposition for very large models

### 4.5.3 Opportunities for Impact {#sec-impact-opportunities}

Despite challenges, several factors favor adoption:

**Timing**: AI governance needs tools now, creating receptive audiences

**Complementarity**: AMTAIR enhances rather than replaces existing processes

**Flexibility**: The approach adapts to different contexts and needs

**Network effects**: Value increases as more perspectives are formalized

Early adopters in research organizations and think tanks can demonstrate value, creating momentum for broader adoption.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-adoption-pathway}: "Planned Stages of AMTAIR rollout/adoption across institutions" -->

## 4.6 Integration with Governance Frameworks {#sec-governance-integration}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Examine how modeling could complement existing AI governance -->

AMTAIR complements and integrates rather than replaces existing governance approaches.

### 4.6.1 Standards Development {#sec-standards-integration}

Technical standards bodies could use AMTAIR to:
- Model how proposed standards affect risk pathways
- Compare different standard options systematically
- Identify unintended consequences through pathway analysis
- Build consensus through explicit model negotiation

Example: Evaluating compute thresholds for AI system regulation by modeling how different thresholds affect capability development, safety investment, and competitive dynamics.



### 4.6.2 Regulatory Design {#sec-regulatory-integration}

### 4.6.3 International Coordination {#sec-international-integration}

Multilateral bodies could leverage shared models for:
- Establishing common risk assessments
- Negotiating agreements with explicit assumptions
- Monitoring compliance through parameter tracking
- Adapting agreements as evidence emerges

Example: Building shared models for AGI development scenarios to inform international AI governance treaties.

<!-- [ ] Improve this somehow -->

### 4.6.4 Organizational Decision-Making {#sec-organizational-integration}

Individual organizations could use AMTAIR for:
- Internal risk assessment and planning

### 4.7.3 Application Domains {#sec-application-future}

**Beyond AI safety**: Climate risk, biosecurity, nuclear policy, and other existential risks

**Corporate governance**: Strategic planning, risk management, and innovation assessment

**Scientific modeling**: Formalizing theoretical arguments in emerging fields

**Educational tools**: Teaching probabilistic reasoning and critical thinking

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-application-domains}: "Potential AMTAIR applications across fields" -->

### 4.7.4 Ecosystem Development {#sec-ecosystem-future}

**Open standards**: Common formats for model exchange and tool interoperability

**Community platforms**: Collaborative model development and sharing infrastructure

**Training programs**: Building capacity for formal modeling in governance communities

**Quality assurance**: Certification processes for high-stakes model applications

These directions could transform AMTAIR from a single tool into a broader ecosystem for enhanced reasoning about complex risks.

<!-- [ ] DESCRIBE: Community development roadmap -->

## 4.8 Known Unknowns and Deep Uncertainties {#sec-deep-uncertainties}

While AMTAIR enhances reasoning under uncertainty, fundamental limitations remain regarding truly novel developments that might fall outside existing conceptual frameworks.

### 4.8.1 Categories of Deep Uncertainty {#sec-uncertainty-categories}

**Novel Capabilities**: Future AI developments may operate according to principles outside current scientific understanding. No amount of careful modeling can anticipate fundamental paradigm shifts in what intelligence can accomplish.

**Emergent Behaviors**: Complex system properties that resist prediction from component analysis may dominate outcomes. The interaction between advanced AI systems and human society could produce wholly unexpected dynamics.

**Strategic Interactions**: Game-theoretic dynamics with superhuman AI systems exceed human modeling capacity. We cannot reliably predict how entities smarter than us will behave strategically.

**Social Transformation**: Unprecedented social and economic changes may invalidate current institutional assumptions. Our models assume continuity in basic social structures that AI might fundamentally alter.





### 4.8.2 Adaptation Strategies for Deep Uncertainty {#sec-adaptation-strategies}

Rather than pretending to model the unmodelable, AMTAIR incorporates several strategies:

**Model Architecture Flexibility**: The modular structure enables rapid incorporation of new variables as novel factors become apparent. When surprises occur, models can be updated rather than discarded.

**Explicit Uncertainty Tracking**: Confidence levels for each model component make clear where knowledge is solid versus speculative. This prevents false confidence in highly uncertain domains.

**Scenario Branching**: Multiple model variants capture different assumptions about fundamental uncertainties. Rather than committing to one worldview, the system maintains portfolios of possibilities.

**Update Mechanisms**: Integration with prediction markets and expert assessment enables rapid model revision as new information emerges. Models evolve rather than remaining static.

### 4.8.3 Robust Decision-Making Principles {#sec-robust-principles}

Given deep uncertainty, certain decision principles become paramount:

**Option Value Preservation**: Policies should maintain flexibility for future course corrections rather than locking in irreversible choices based on current models.

**Portfolio Diversification**: Multiple approaches hedging across different uncertainty sources provide robustness against model error.

**Early Warning Systems**: Monitoring for developments that would invalidate current models enables rapid response when assumptions break down.

**Adaptive Governance**: Institutional mechanisms must enable rapid response to new information rather than rigid adherence to plans based on outdated models.

The goal is not to eliminate uncertainty but to make good decisions despite it. AMTAIR provides tools for systematic reasoning about what we do know while maintaining appropriate humility about what we don't and can't know.

These limitations and considerations do not diminish AMTAIR's value but rather clarify its proper role: a tool for enhancing coordination and decision-making under uncertainty, not a crystal ball for predicting the future. With realistic expectations about capabilities and limitations, we can now examine the concrete contributions and future directions for this research. The concluding chapter summarizes key findings and charts a path forward for computational approaches to AI governance.

## 5.1 Summary of Key Contributions {#sec-key-contributions}

This thesis has demonstrated both the need for and feasibility of computational approaches to enhancing coordination in AI governance. The work makes several distinct contributions across theory, methodology, and implementation.

### 5.1.1 Theoretical Contributions {#sec-theoretical-contributions}

**Diagnosis of the Coordination Crisis**: I've articulated how fragmentation across technical, policy, and strategic communities systematically amplifies existential risk from advanced AI. This framing moves beyond identifying disagreements to understanding how misaligned efforts create negative-sum dynamics—safety gaps emerge between communities, resources are misallocated through duplication and neglect, and interventions interact destructively.

**The Multiplicative Benefits Framework**: The combination of automated extraction, prediction market integration, and formal policy evaluation creates value exceeding the sum of parts. Automation enables scale, markets provide empirical grounding, and policy analysis delivers actionable insights. Together, they address different facets of the coordination challenge while reinforcing each other's strengths.

**Epistemic Infrastructure Conception**: Positioning formal models as epistemic infrastructure reframes the role of technical tools in governance. Rather than replacing human judgment, computational approaches provide common languages, shared representations, and systematic methods for managing disagreement—essential foundations for coordination under uncertainty.

### 5.1.2 Methodological Innovations {#sec-methodological-innovations}

**Two-Stage Extraction Architecture**: Separating structural extraction (ArgDown) from probability quantification (BayesDown) addresses key challenges in automated formalization. This modularity enables human oversight at critical points, supports multiple quantification methods, allows for unprecedented transparency and explainability of the entire process, and isolates different types of errors for targeted improvement.

**BayesDown as Bridge Representation**: The development of BayesDown syntax creates a crucial intermediate representation preserving both narrative accessibility and mathematical precision. This bridge enables the transformation from qualitative arguments to quantitative models while maintaining traceability and human readability.

**Validation Framework**: The systematic approach to validating automated extraction—comparing against expert annotations, measuring multiple accuracy dimensions, and analyzing error patterns—establishes scientific standards for assessing formalization tools. This framework can guide future development in this emerging area.



### 5.1.3 Technical Achievements {#sec-technical-achievements}

**Working Implementation**: AMTAIR demonstrates end-to-end feasibility from document ingestion through interactive visualization. The system achieves practically useful accuracy levels: 85%+ for structural extraction and 73% for probability capture on real AI safety arguments.

**Scalability Solutions**: Technical approaches for handling realistic model complexity—hierarchical decomposition, approximate inference, and progressive visualization—show that computational limitations need not prevent practical application.

**Accessibility Design**: The layered interface approach serves diverse stakeholders without compromising technical depth. Progressive disclosure, visual encoding, and interactive exploration make formal models accessible beyond technical specialists.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#tbl-achievement-metrics}: "Quantitative summary of technical achievements" -->

### 5.1.4 Empirical Findings {#sec-empirical-findings}

**Extraction Feasibility**: The successful extraction of complex arguments like Carlsmith's model validates the core premise that implicit formal structures exist in natural language arguments and can be computationally recovered with reasonable fidelity.

**Convergence Patterns**: Comparative analysis reveals structural agreement across repeated extraction even when probability estimates diverge substantially. This suggests shared understanding of the understanding causal models, argument structure and worldview despite parameter disagreements—a foundation for coordination.

**Intervention Impacts**: Policy evaluation demonstrates how formal models enable rigorous assessment of governance options. The ability to quantify risk reduction across scenarios and identify robust strategies validates the practical value of formalization.




## 5.2 Limitations and Honest Assessment {#sec-limitations-assessment}

Despite these contributions, important limitations constrain current capabilities and should guide appropriate use.

### 5.2.1 Technical Constraints {#sec-technical-constraints}

**Extraction Boundaries**: Potential sources of systematic biases and confounding variables remain. Similar to experts, the automated system still struggles with implicit and hidden assumptions and complex conditionals. These limitations necessitate human review for high-stakes applications.

**Correlation Handling**: Over simplified Bayesian networks inadequately represent complex correlations in real systems. While extensions like copulas and explicit correlation nodes help, fully capturing interdependencies remains challenging.

**Computational Scaling**: Very large networks (>>500 nodes) require approximations that may affect accuracy. As models grow to represent richer phenomena, computational constraints increasingly bind.


### 5.2.2 Conceptual Limitations {#sec-conceptual-limitations}

**Formalization Trade-offs**: Converting rich arguments to formal models necessarily loses nuance. While making assumptions explicit provides value, some unspoken insights may resist clear mathematical representation.

**Probability Interpretation**: Deep uncertainty about unprecedented events challenges probabilistic intuitions. Numbers can create false precision even when explicitly conditional and uncertain.

**Social Complexity**: Institutional dynamics, cultural factors, and political processes influence AI development in ways that purely causal models struggle to capture.



### 5.2.3 Practical Constraints {#sec-practical-constraints}

**Adoption Barriers**: Learning curves, institutional inertia, and resource requirements limit immediate deployment. Even demonstrably valuable tools face implementation challenges.

**Maintenance Burden**: Models require updating as arguments evolve and evidence emerges. Without sustained effort, formal representations quickly become outdated.

**Context Dependence**: The approach works best for well-structured academic arguments. Application to "fuzzy" informal discussions, political speeches, or social media remains challenging.

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-limitation-landscape}: "Visual summary of system limitations" -->

## 5.3 Implications for AI Governance {#sec-governance-implications}

<!-- [ ] TODO: Provide concrete recommendations for stakeholders -->

Despite limitations, AMTAIR's approach offers significant implications for how AI governance can evolve toward greater coordination and effectiveness.

### 5.3.1 Near-Term Applications {#sec-near-term-applications}

**Research Coordination**: Research organizations can use formal models to:
- Map the landscape of current arguments and identify gaps
- Prioritize investigations targeting high-sensitivity parameters
- Build cumulative knowledge through explicit model updating
- Facilitate collaboration through shared representations

**Policy Development**: Governance bodies can apply the framework to:
- Evaluate proposals across multiple expert worldviews
- Identify robust interventions effective under uncertainty
- Make assumptions explicit for democratic scrutiny
- Track how evidence changes optimal policies over time

**Stakeholder Communication**: The visualization and analysis tools enable:
- Clearer communication between technical and policy communities
- Public engagement with complex risk assessments
- Board-level strategic discussions grounded in formal analysis
- International negotiations with explicit shared models

<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-near-term-impact}: "Planned Pathways to AMTAIR adoption" -->




### 5.3.2 Medium-Term Transformation {#sec-medium-term}

As adoption spreads, we might see:

**Epistemic Commons**: Shared repositories of formalized arguments become reference points for governance discussions, similar to how economic models inform monetary policy or climate models guide environmental agreements.

**Adaptive Governance**: Policies designed with explicit models can include triggers for reassessment as key parameters change, enabling responsive governance that avoids both paralysis and recklessness.

**Professionalization**: "Model curator" and "argument formalization specialist" emerge as recognized roles, building expertise in bridging natural language and formal representations.

**Quality Standards**: Community norms develop around model transparency, validation requirements, and appropriate use cases, preventing both dismissal and over-reliance on formal tools.





### 5.3.3 Long-Term Vision {#sec-long-term-vision}

Successfully scaling this approach could fundamentally alter AI governance:

**Coordinated Response**: Rather than fragmented efforts, the AI safety ecosystem could operate with shared situational awareness—different actors understanding how their efforts interact and contribute to collective goals.

**Anticipatory Action**: Formal models with prediction market integration could provide early warning of emerging risks, enabling proactive rather than reactive governance.

**Global Cooperation**: Shared formal frameworks could facilitate international coordination similar to how economic models enable monetary coordination or climate models support environmental agreements.

**Democratic Enhancement**: Making expert reasoning transparent and modifiable could enable broader participation in crucial decisions about humanity's technological future.

## 5.6 Closing Reflections {#sec-closing-reflections}

The work presented in this thesis emerges from a simple observation: while humanity mobilizes unprecedented resources to address AI risks, our efforts remain tragically uncoordinated. Different communities work with incompatible frameworks, duplicate efforts, and sometimes actively undermine each other's work. This fragmentation amplifies the very risks we seek to mitigate.

AMTAIR represents one attempt to build bridges—computational tools that create common ground for disparate perspectives. By making implicit models explicit, quantifying uncertainty, and enabling systematic policy analysis, these tools offer hope for enhanced coordination. The successful extraction of complex arguments, validation against expert judgment, and demonstration of policy evaluation capabilities suggest this approach has merit.

Yet tools alone cannot solve coordination problems rooted in incentives, institutions, and human psychology. AMTAIR provides infrastructure for coordination, not coordination itself. Success requires not just technical development but changes in how we approach collective challenges—valuing transparency over strategic ambiguity, embracing uncertainty rather than false confidence, and prioritizing collective outcomes over parochial interests.

The path forward demands both ambition and humility. Ambition to build the epistemic infrastructure necessary for navigating unprecedented risks. Humility to recognize our tools' limitations and the irreducible role of human wisdom in governance. The question is not whether formal models can replace human judgment—they cannot and should not. Rather, it's whether we can augment our collective intelligence with computational tools that help us reason together about futures too important to leave to chance.

::: {.callout-important}
## The Stakes

As AI capabilities advance toward transformative potential, the window for establishing effective governance narrows. We cannot afford continued fragmentation when facing potentially irreversible consequences. The coordination crisis in AI governance represents both existential risk and existential opportunity—risk if we fail to align our efforts, opportunity if we succeed in building unprecedented cooperation around humanity's most important challenge.
:::

This thesis contributes technical foundations and demonstrates feasibility. The greater work—building communities, changing practices, and fostering coordination—remains ahead. May we prove equal to the task, for all our futures depend on it.
