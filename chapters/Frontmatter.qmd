## Checklists <!-- [ ] Final Checklists -->

## “Usual paper requirements”

* introduce all terminology  
  - go through text, make sure all terms are defined, explained (and added to the list of Abbr.) when first mentioned  
* readership is intelligent and interested but has no prior knowledge

## (Format:) \~ Anything that makes it easier to understand

- short sentences  
- paragraphs (one idea per paragraph)  
- simplicity  
- \!limit use of passive voice\!  
- use active voice, even prefer I over we\!  
- minimise use of “zombi nouns” (don’t turn verbs/adjectives to nouns\!)  
- “find words that can be cut”

– the paper can **focus** on **one aspect of the presentation**

– “open door policy” for (content) questions

\~ demonstrate ability for novel research

– “solve research question with the tools accessible to you”

– “show something that has not been shown before / should be publishable in principle”

– new idea (or criticism) “in this field” 

– Outline idea THEN reading with a purpose (answering concrete questions)

– “Only” confirm that nobody has published the exact same idea on the same topic

– pretty much determined by presentation & proposal but narrow down further (& choose supervisor?)

Here is a second footnote reference,[^1] and another.

[^longnote]



[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented. -->
