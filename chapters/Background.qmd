## Theoretical Foundations

### **AI Existential Risk: The Carlsmith Model**

\<\!-- Examine Joe Carlsmith's probabilistic model of power-seeking AI causing existential catastrophe. Unpack the six key premises and explain why this structured approach serves as an ideal candidate for formal modeling. \--\>

### **The Epistemic Challenge of Policy Evaluation**

\<\!-- Explore why evaluating AI governance policies is particularly difficult: complex causal chains, deep uncertainty, divergent worldviews, and limited empirical data. Establish why traditional policy analysis methods are insufficient. \--\>

### **Argument Mapping and Formal Representations**

\<\!-- Bridge informal reasoning to formal models by showing how argument maps capture causal relationships and conditional dependencies that can be translated into Bayesian networks. \--\>

### **Bayesian Networks as Knowledge Representation**

\<\!-- Introduce Bayesian networks as formal tools for representing uncertainty, causal relationships, and conditional dependencies. Explain key concepts: nodes, edges, conditional probability tables, and inference. \--\>

### **The MTAIR Framework: Achievements and Limitations**

\<\!-- Review the MTAIR project's approach to modeling AI risks using Analytica, highlighting both its innovations and limitations, particularly the manual labor intensity that limits scalability. \--\>

### **2.6 "A Narrow Path": Conditional Policy Proposals in Practice**

\<\!-- Examine "A Narrow Path" as a case study of conditional policy proposals, highlighting how formal modeling could clarify the conditions under which specific policy interventions would be effective. \--\>
