## Implementation

System Architecture and Data Flow
<!-- Present the overall architecture of the P(Doom) calculator, showing how different components interact. Explain the data pipeline from extraction through modeling to visualization and policy evaluation. -->
Automated Extraction Pipeline
<!-- Detail the implementation of the automated extraction system, including LLM prompt design, validation procedures, and performance metrics. Provide specific examples showing the transition from text to formal model. -->

Network Construction and Visualization

<!-- Describe the implementation of the DAG construction and visualization components, explaining both the mathematical representation and the user interface design considerations. -->

Probabilistic Inference Engine

<!-- Present the implementation of the inference engine, with particular attention to handling complex networks efficiently. Discuss optimization techniques and computational constraints. -->

Prediction Market Integration Module
<!-- Detail the implementation of connections to prediction markets and forecasting platforms, including API interactions, data processing, and update mechanisms. -->
4.6 Policy Evaluation Interface
<!-- Describe the interface for policy evaluation, showing how users can define interventions, set conditions, and analyze outcomes. Explain design choices that enhance interpretability and usability. -->
