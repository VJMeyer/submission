### System Architecture and Data Flow {#sec-system-architecture}

<!-- [ ] Present the overall architecture of AMTAIR, showing how different components interact --> 
<!-- [ ] Explain the data pipeline from extraction through modeling to visualization and policy evaluation -->

> The AMTAIR system implements an end-to-end pipeline from unstructured text to interactive Bayesian network visualization. Its modular architecture comprises five main components that progressively transform information from natural language into formal models.

`Core system components include:

1. Text Ingestion and Preprocessing: Handles format normalization, metadata extraction, and relevance filtering
2. BayesDown Extraction: Identifies argument structures, causal relationships, and probabilistic judgments
3. Structured Data Transformation: Parses representations into standardized data formats
4. Bayesian Network Construction: Creates formal network representations with nodes and edges
5. Interactive Visualization: Renders networks as explorable visual interfaces`

### Rain-Sprinkler-Grass Example Implementation {#sec-rain-sprinkler-grass}

<!-- [ ] Demonstrate the pipeline using the canonical Rain-Sprinkler-Lawn example --> 
<!-- [ ] Provide a detailed walkthrough of each transformation stage -->

> The Rain-Sprinkler-Grass example serves as a canonical test case demonstrating each step in the AMTAIR pipeline. This simple causal scenario—where both rain and sprinkler use can cause wet grass, and rain influences sprinkler use—provides an intuitive introduction to Bayesian network concepts while exercising all system components.

`The implementation walkthrough includes:

1. Source representation in natural language
2. Extraction to ArgDown format with structural relationships
3. Enhancement to BayesDown with probability information
4. Transformation into structured data tables
5. Construction of the Bayesian network
6. Interactive visualization with probability encoding`

```{=python}
# Example code snippet demonstrating network construction
def create_bayesian_network_with_probabilities(df):
    """Create an interactive Bayesian network visualization with probability encoding"""
    # Create a directed graph
    G = nx.DiGraph()
    
    # Add nodes with proper attributes
    for idx, row in df.iterrows():
        title = row['Title']
        description = row['Description']
        
        # Process probability information
        priors = get_priors(row)
        instantiations = get_instantiations(row)
        
        # Add node with base information
        G.add_node(
            title,
            description=description,
            priors=priors,
            instantiations=instantiations,
            posteriors=get_posteriors(row)
        )

### Carlsmith Implementation {#sec-carlsmith-implementation}

<!-- [ ] Apply the same pipeline to the more complex Carlsmith model of power-seeking AI --> 
<!-- [ ] Explain how the system handles more complex causal relationships and uncertainty -->

> Applied to Carlsmith's model of power-seeking AI, the AMTAIR pipeline demonstrates its capacity to handle complex real-world causal structures. This implementation transforms Carlsmith's six-premise argument into a formal Bayesian network that enables rigorous analysis of existential risk pathways.

`Key aspects of the implementation include:

1. Extraction of the multi-level causal structure
2. Representation of Carlsmith's explicit probability estimates
3. Identification of implicit conditional relationships
4. Visualization of the complete risk model
5. Analysis of critical pathways and parameters`

```{=python}
# Example code showing probability extraction for Carlsmith model
def extract_bayesdown_probabilities(questions_md, model_name="claude-3-opus-20240229"):
    """Extract probability estimates from natural language using frontier LLMs"""
    provider = LLMFactory.create_provider("anthropic")
    
    # Get probability extraction prompt
    prompt_template = PromptLibrary.get_template("BAYESDOWN_EXTRACTION")
    prompt = prompt_template.format(questions=questions_md)
    
    # Call the LLM for probability estimation
    response = provider.complete(
        prompt=prompt,
        system_prompt="You are an expert in causal reasoning and probability estimation.",
        model=model_name,
        temperature=0.2,
        max_tokens=4000
    )

### Inference & Extensions {#sec-inference-extensions}

<!-- [ ] Describe the additional analytical capabilities built on the formal model representation --> 
<!-- [ ] Showcase how inference, sensitivity analysis, and policy evaluation work in practice -->

> Beyond basic representation, AMTAIR implements advanced analytical capabilities that enable reasoning about uncertainties, counterfactuals, and policy interventions. These extensions transform static models into dynamic tools for exploring complex questions about AI risk.

`Key inference capabilities include:

1. Probability queries for outcomes of interest
2. Sensitivity analysis identifying critical parameters
3. Counterfactual reasoning for policy evaluation
4. Intervention modeling for strategy development
5. Comparative analysis across different worldviews`

```{=python}
# Example code demonstrating sensitivity analysis
def perform_sensitivity_analysis(model, target_node, parameter_ranges):
    """Analyze how varying input parameters affects target outcome probabilities"""
    results = {}
    
    for parameter, range_values in parameter_ranges.items():
        parameter_results = []
        original_value = model.get_cpds(parameter).values
        
        # Test each parameter value and record outcome
        for test_value in range_values:
            # Create modified model with test parameter
            temp_model = model.copy()
            update_parameter(temp_model, parameter, test_value)
            
            # Perform inference to get target probability
            inference = VariableElimination(temp_model)
            result = inference.query([target_node])
            
            parameter_results.append((test_value, result[target_node].values))
            
        results[parameter] = parameter_results
        
    return results
```
