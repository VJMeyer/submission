## Methodology

### From World Models to Computational Representation

#### Research Design Overview

<!-- Present the overall research approach, combining theoretical development, software implementation, validation testing, and policy application. Clarify the iterative nature of the process. -->

#### Formalizing World Models from AI Safety Literature
<!-- Detail the process of extracting causal relationships, key variables, and probabilistic judgments from AI safety literature. Explain the role of LLMs in this process and the development of prompt engineering techniques to improve extraction quality. -->

#### Directed Acyclic Graphs: Structure and Semantics

<!-- Explain the mathematical properties of DAGs and their semantic interpretation in the context of AI risk modeling. Cover both structural and parametric aspects of the models. -->

#### Quantification Approaches for Probabilistic Judgments

<!-- Examine methods for converting qualitative judgments into quantitative probabilities, including expert elicitation, calibration techniques, and sensitivity analysis. Discuss challenges of aggregating diverse probabilistic judgments. -->

#### Inference Techniques for Complex Networks

<!-- Review Monte Carlo sampling and other inference techniques for complex Bayesian networks, explaining their application to policy evaluation. Discuss computational complexity considerations and approximation methods. -->


#### Integration with Prediction Markets and Forecasting Platforms
<!-- Detail methods for connecting the formal models with live data sources from prediction markets and forecasting platforms. Explain data standardization, weighting mechanisms, and update procedures. -->
