## Problem Statement — Motivation

Continued AI Progress:

-   Rapid advancements in AI technology increase both potential benefits and risks.

Existential Risks (AI X-Risk):

-   Advanced AI systems could pose significant threats if misaligned with human values.

Complexity Challenges:

-   The intricate nature of AI systems complicates policy formulation and understanding.

Limitations of Current Approaches:

-   MTAIR’s Reliance on Human Labor:
    -   Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) is constrained by manual cognitive efforts.\
-   Need for Automation:
    -   Scaling and automating risk modeling is essential to keep pace with AI developments.

Opportunity:

-   Leveraging new technologies to enhance our ability to model and mitigate AI risks.

## Aim of the Paper

### Research Question & Scope

#### Can frontier AI technologies be utilized to automate the modeling of transformative AI risks, so as to allow for the prediction of policy impacts?

Frontier AI Technology: Today’s most capable AI systems (e.g. GPT4 level LLMs)\
Scaling Up: Automating the previously “manual” cognitive labor\
Modeling: Formalizing the world views underlying arguments\
Transformative AI: Level of AI capabilities defined by severe impact on the world\
Safety & Governance Literature: Publications, reports etc. concerned with risks from AI

Automated Estimation: Non-manual (AI systems + scaffolding), quantified evaluations\
Probability Distributions: Formal expressions of the expectations over future worlds\
Conditional Trees of Possible Worlds: “If … then…” reasoning over ways things may play out\
Forecasting Policy Impacts: Qualitative & quantitative evaluation of expected outcomes

### Significance of the Research

## Theory of Change — Approach & Structure of the Paper

Multiplicative Benefits:

-   Automation × Live Prediction Market Integrations × Policy Impact Evaluations

Explanation:\
Automation:

-   Increases efficiency and scalability of risk modeling.

    Live Prediction Markets:

-   Provides up-to-date, collective intelligence to inform models.

    Policy Impact Evaluations:

-   Improves the accuracy and relevance of policy assessments.

Outcome:

-   Enhanced ability to develop effective policies that mitigate AI risks.

Visual Aid:

-   A diagram illustrating how each component amplifies the others, leading to greater overall impact.

### The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance

<!-- Frame the problem as one of coordination failure rather than merely technical challenge. Highlight how even with substantial resources and attention, AI governance efforts remain fragmented and inefficient due to lack of systematic modeling approaches. -->

### 1.2 Research Question and Scope

<!-- Primary research question: "Can frontier AI technologies be utilized to automate the modeling of transformative AI risks, enabling robust prediction of policy impacts?" Define boundaries of inquiry, focusing on formal modeling of existential risks from transformative AI. -->

### 1.3 The Multiplicative Benefits Framework

<!-- Establish the central thesis that the combination of (1) automated extraction, (2) prediction market integration, and (3) formal policy evaluation creates multiplicative rather than merely additive benefits for AI governance. This section sets up the theoretical foundation for the entire paper. -->

### 1.4 From Theory to Practice: A Roadmap

<!-- Preview the paper's structure, explaining how each section builds toward a practical implementation of the framework. Emphasize both theoretical rigor and practical utility. -->
