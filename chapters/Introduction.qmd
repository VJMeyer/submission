## Problem Statement — Motivation

Continued AI Progress:

-   Rapid advancements in AI technology increase both potential benefits and risks.

Existential Risks (AI X-Risk):

-   Advanced AI systems could pose significant threats if misaligned with human values.

Complexity Challenges:

-   The intricate nature of AI systems complicates policy formulation and understanding.

Limitations of Current Approaches:

-   MTAIR’s Reliance on Human Labor:
    -   Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) is constrained by manual cognitive efforts.\
-   Need for Automation:
    -   Scaling and automating risk modeling is essential to keep pace with AI developments.

Opportunity:

-   Leveraging new technologies to enhance our ability to model and mitigate AI risks.

## Aim of the Paper

### Research Question & Scope

#### Can frontier AI technologies be utilized to automate the modeling of transformative AI risks, so as to allow for the prediction of policy impacts?

Frontier AI Technology: Today’s most capable AI systems (e.g. GPT4 level LLMs)\
Scaling Up: Automating the previously “manual” cognitive labor\
Modeling: Formalizing the world views underlying arguments\
Transformative AI: Level of AI capabilities defined by severe impact on the world\
Safety & Governance Literature: Publications, reports etc. concerned with risks from AI

Automated Estimation: Non-manual (AI systems + scaffolding), quantified evaluations\
Probability Distributions: Formal expressions of the expectations over future worlds\
Conditional Trees of Possible Worlds: “If … then…” reasoning over ways things may play out\
Forecasting Policy Impacts: Qualitative & quantitative evaluation of expected outcomes

### Significance of the Research
