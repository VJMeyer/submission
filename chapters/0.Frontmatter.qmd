## For Callouts

Quarto's native callouts work without additional packages:

::: {.callout-note}
## Important Note2
This renders perfectly in both HTML and PDF.2
:::

Also for markdown:

```markdown
::: {.render_as_markdown_example}
## Markdown Heading
This renders perfectly in both HTML and PDF but as markdown "plain text"
:::
```

## Section Cross-References {#sec-crossref}

Refer to sections like: @sec-adaptive-governance and @sec-crossref


```markdown
Caveat: refering to sections with @sec-HEADINGS works only for sections with:
## Heading {#sec-HEADINGS}
It does not work for sections with ".unnumbered and/or .unlisted":
## Heading {#sec-HEADINGS .unnumbered .unlisted}
```


## Reference or Embed Code from .ipynb files

#### Code chunks from .ipynb notebooks can be embedded in the .qmd text with:

```markdown
{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#my_code_cell_test >}}
```
#### which produces the output of executing the code cell:

{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#my_code_cell_test >}}

#### including 'echo=true' renders the code of the cell:

```markdown
{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#my_code_cell_test echo=true >}}
```

{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#my_code_cell_test echo=true >}}

  #fig-automation_pipeline
  fig-scap="Five-step AMTAIR automation pipeline from PDFs to Bayesian networks" 
  fig-alt="FLOWCHART: Five-step automation pipeline workflow for AMTAIR project.
          DATA: The pipeline transforms PDFs through ArgDown, BayesDown, CSV, and HTML into Bayesian network visualizations.
          PURPOSE: Illustrates the core technical process that enables automated extraction of probabilistic models from AI safety literature.
          DETAILS: Five numbered green steps show: (1) LLM-based extraction from PDFs to ArgDown, (2) ArgDown to BayesDown completion with probabilities, (3) Extracting world-models as CSV data, (4) Software tools for data inference, and (5) Visualization of the resulting Bayesian network.
          Each step includes example outputs, with the final visualization showing a Rain-Sprinkler-Grass Wet Bayesian network with probability tables.

## (Format:) \~ Anything that makes it easier to understand

- short sentences  
- paragraphs (one idea per paragraph)  
- simplicity  
- \!limit use of passive voice\!  
- use active voice, even prefer I over we\!  
- minimise use of “zombi nouns” (don’t turn verbs/adjectives to nouns\!)  
- “find words that can be cut”

– the paper can **focus** on **one aspect of the presentation**

– “open door policy” for (content) questions

\~ demonstrate ability for novel research

– “solve research question with the tools accessible to you”

– “show something that has not been shown before / should be publishable in principle”

– new idea (or criticism) “in this field” 

– Outline idea THEN reading with a purpose (answering concrete questions)

– “Only” confirm that nobody has published the exact same idea on the same topic

– pretty much determined by presentation & proposal but narrow down further (& choose supervisor?)

<!-- [ ] Trouble shoot and fix referencing sections -->

Referencing Sections \ref{sec-citations}. Works in PDF.

headings as [@sec-heading]. Works in html




Here is a second footnote reference,[^1] and another.

[^longnote]



[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented. -->
