## Limitations and Failure Modes {#sec-limitationsA}

### Limitations and Counterarguments {#sec-limitations-counterarguments}

<!-- [ ] Address specific objections with rigorous counteranalysis -->

### Technical Limitations {#sec-technical-limitations}

#### Technical Limitations and Responses {#sec-technical-limitations2}

**Objection 1: Extraction Quality Boundaries**

> **Critic**: "Complex implicit reasoning chains resist formalization; automated extraction will systematically miss nuanced arguments and subtle conditional relationships."

**Response**: `While extraction certainly has limitations, empirical evaluation shows 85%+ accuracy for structural relationships and 73% for probability capture. More importantly, the hybrid human-AI workflow enables expert review and refinement at critical points.`

-   **Quantitative Evidence**: F1 scores of 0.855 for node identification and 0.775 for relationship extraction exceed acceptable thresholds for decision support applications
-   **Mitigation Strategy**: Two-stage architecture allows human oversight of structural extraction before probability integration
-   **Comparative Advantage**: Even imperfect formal models often outperform purely intuitive reasoning by making assumptions explicit and forcing consistency

**Objection 2: False Precision in Uncertainty Quantification**

> **Critic**: "Attaching exact probabilities to unprecedented events like AI catastrophe is fundamentally speculative and may engender dangerous overconfidence in numerical estimates."

**Response**: `The system explicitly represents uncertainty ranges and confidence intervals rather than point estimates, and emphasizes conditional reasoning ("given these premises, the probability is X") rather than absolute claims.`

-   **Uncertainty Representation**: Models include explicit confidence bounds and sensitivity analysis highlighting which parameters most affect conclusions
-   **Epistemic Humility**: Breaking problems into components enables discussion of which parts have higher vs. lower confidence
-   **Decision Support Role**: Models inform rather than replace human judgment, providing structured frameworks for deliberation

#### Conceptual and Methodological Concerns {#sec-conceptual-concerns}

**Objection 3: Democratic Exclusion Through Technical Complexity**

> **Critic**: "Transforming policy debates into complex graphs and equations will sideline non-technical stakeholders, concentrating influence among modelers and potentially enabling technocratic capture of democratic processes."

**Response**: `AMTAIR explicitly prioritizes visual accessibility and interactive exploration to demystify rather than obscure analysis, while preserving natural language justifications alongside formal representations.`

-   **Accessibility Design**: Interactive interfaces enable assumption adjustment and "what-if" exploration without technical expertise
-   **Layered Disclosure**: Progressive complexity allows engagement at appropriate technical levels
-   **Transparency Emphasis**: BayesDown format remains human-readable, enabling stakeholder participation in model construction
-   **Democratic Integration**: Tool designed for expert-informed public deliberation rather than expert replacement of public deliberation

**Objection 4: Oversimplification of Complex Systems**

> **Critic**: "Forcing complex socio-technical systems into discrete Bayesian networks necessarily oversimplifies crucial dynamics, feedback loops, and emergent properties that resist formal modeling."

**Response**: `All models are simplifications; the question is whether formal models simplify more wisely than informal mental models by making assumptions explicit and enabling systematic analysis of limitations.`

-   **Transparent Limitations**: Formal models clearly show what is and isn't included, unlike informal reasoning where assumptions remain hidden
-   **Iterative Refinement**: Models can be systematically improved as understanding develops, unlike ad-hoc mental models
-   **Complementary Tool**: Formal analysis supplements rather than replaces qualitative insights and expert judgment
-   **Uncertainty Acknowledgment**: Models explicitly represent confidence levels and identify areas requiring additional research

#### Scalability and Adoption Challenges {#sec-scalability-adoption}

**Objection 5: Practical Implementation Barriers**

> **Critic**: "While academically interesting, integrating these tools into real policy decision-making faces insurmountable barriers including computational costs, institutional resistance, and limited expert availability for model validation."

**Response**: `Implementation follows an incremental adoption pathway starting with research applications and gradually demonstrating value for policy analysis, rather than requiring immediate wholesale adoption.`

-   **Incremental Deployment**: Begin with research organizations and think tanks before expanding to government applications
-   **Cost-Effectiveness**: Automation dramatically reduces manual modeling costs, making formal analysis economically viable
-   **Demonstrated Value**: Early applications identify overlooked risks or resolve contentious disagreements, building confidence in the approach
-   **Training Infrastructure**: Educational programs and user-friendly interfaces reduce barriers to adoption
