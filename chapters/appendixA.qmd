    # Quarto Syntax {#sec-syntax}

    ## Main Formatting

    ### Html Comments

    <!-- Comments for comments -->


    ## Syntax for Tasks


    ### Tasks with ToDo Tree


    #### Simple "One-line tasks"

    Use Code ticks and html comment and task format for tasks distinctly visible across all formats including the ToDo-Tree overview:

    `<!-- [ ] ToDos for things to do / tasks / reminders (allows "jump to with Taks Tree extension") -->`

    Use html comment and task format for open or uncertain tasks, visible in the .qmd file:

    <!-- [ ] ToDos for things to do / tasks / reminders (allows "jump to with Taks Tree extension") -->



    #### More Complex Tasks with Notes

    ```         
    <!-- [ ] Task Title: short description-->

      More Information about task

      Relevant notes

      Step-by-step implementation Plan

      Etc.

    ```

    #### Completed Tasks

    Retain completed tasks in ToDo-Tree by adding an x in the brackets: `[x]`
    `<!-- [x] Tasks which have been finished but should remain for later verification -->`

    <!-- [x] Tasks which have been finished but should remain for later verification -->


    Mark and remove completed tasks from ToDo-Tree by adding a minus in the brackets: `[-]`

    `<!-- [-] Tasks which have been finished but should remain visible for later verification -->`

    <!-- [-] Tasks which have been finished but should remain for later verification (only in .qmd) -->

    #### Missing Citations

    `<!-- [ ] FIND: @CITATION_KEY_PURPOSE: "Description of the appropriate/idea source, including ideas /suggestions / search terms etc." -->`

    #### Suggested Citation

    `<!-- [ ] VERIFY: @CITATION_KEY_SUGGESTED: "Description of the appropriate paper, book, source" [Include BibTex if known] -->`

    #### Missing Graphic

    `<!-- [ ] FIND: {#fig-GRAPHIC_IDEA}]: "Description of the appropriate/idea source, including ideas /suggestions / search terms etc." -->`

    #### Suggested Graphic

    `<!-- [ ] VERIFY: {#fig-GRAPHIC_IDEA}: "Description of the appropriate paper, book, source" [Include figure syntax if known] -->`

    Missing and/or suggested tables, concepts, explanations as well as other elements should be suggested similarily.

    ### Task Syntax Examples

    `<!-- [ ] (Example short: open and visible in text)   Find and list the names of the MTAIR team-members responsible for the Analytica Implementation -->`



    ```
    <!-- [ ] (Example longer: open and visible in text)    Review/Plan/Discuss integrating Live Prediction Markets -->

      Live prediction market integration requires:
        (1) API connections to platforms (Metaculus, Manifold),
        (2) Question-to-variable mapping algorithms,
        (3) Probability update mechanisms, 
        (4) Handling of market dynamics (thin markets, manipulation).
        Current mentions may overstate readiness or underestimate complexity.
        Need realistic assessment of what's achievable.

      Implementation Steps:
          0. List/mention all relevant platforms with a brief description each
          1. Review all existing prediction market mentions for accuracy
          2. Assess actual API availability and limitations
          3. Describe/explain/discuss how to implement basic proof-of-concept with single platform
          4. Document challenges: question mapping, market interpretation
          5. Create realistic timeline for full implementation
          6. Revise thesis claims to match reality
          7. Add "Future Work" and/or extension section on complete integration
          8. Include descriptions of mockups/designs even if not fully built 
          9. Highlight/discuss the advantages of such integrations
          10. Quickly brainstorm for downsides worth mentioning
    ```

    <!-- [x] (Example: done but remaining as a reminder in .qmd and visible in ToDo Tree until verified)   Verify that the Orcid IDs are correct -->

    <!-- [-] (Example: done and verified but remaining as a peristent reminder)  Test and verify correct inclusion and formatting of .md files  -->

    ### Verbatim Code Formatting

    `verbatim code formatting for notes and ideas to be included (here)`

    ### Code Block formatting

    ```         
    Also code blocks for more extensive notes and ideas to be included and checklists
    - test 1. 
    - test 2. 
    - test 3.
    2. second
    3. third
    ```

    ```         
    code
    ```

    Add a language to syntax highlight code blocks:

    ``` python
    1 + 1
    ```

    ### Blockquote Formatting

    > Blockquote formatting for "Suggested Citations (e.g. carlsmith 2024 on ...)" and/or claims which require a citation (e.g. claim x should be backed-up by a ciation from the literature)

    ### Tables

    ## Headings & Potential Headings in Standard Markdown formatting ('\##') {#sec-heading}

    ### Heading 3

    #### Heading 4

    <!-- Using Headings deeper than 4 requires some LaTeX fix -->

    <!-- [ ] Enable Headings 5 & 6 -->

    <!-- ##### Heading 5 -->

    <!-- ###### Heading 6 -->

    ## Text Formatting Options

    *italics*, **bold**, ***bold italics***

    superscript^2^ and subscript~2~

    ~~strikethrough~~

    [This text is highlighted]{.mark}

    [This text is underlined]{.underline}

    [This text is smallcaps]{.smallcaps}

    ## Lists

    -   unordered list

        -   sub-item 1
        -   sub-item 2
            -   sub-sub-item 1

    -   item 2

        Continued (indent 4 spaces)

    1.  ordered list
    2.  item 2
        i)  sub-item 1
            A.  sub-sub-item 1

    ## Math

    inline math: $E = mc^{2}$

    display math:

    $$E = mc^{2}$$

    If you want to define custom TeX macros, include them within \$\$ delimiters enclosed in a .hidden block. For example:

    ::: hidden
    $$
    \def\RR{{\bf R}}
    \def\bold#1{{\bf #1}}
    $$
    :::

    For HTML math processed using MathJax (the default) you can use the \\def, \\newcommand, \\renewcommand, \\newenvironment, \\renewenvironment, and \\let commands to create your own macros and environments.

    ## Footnotes

    Here is an inline note.[^index-1]

    [^index-1]: Inlines notes are easier to write, since you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the note.

    Here is a footnote reference,[^index-2]

    [^index-2]: Here is the footnote.

    Another Text with a footnote[^index-3] but this time a "longnote".

    [^index-3]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

        Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they belong to the previous footnote.

        ```         
        { some.code }
        ```

        The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first line. In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like multi-paragraph list items.

    This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it isn't indented.

    ## Callouts {#sec-callouts}

    Quarto's native callouts work without additional packages:

    ::: note
    This is written in a 'note' environment -- but it does not seem to produce any special rendering.
    :::

    ::: callout-note
    ### Optional Title

    Content here
    :::

    ::: callout-note
    ### Important Note2

    This renders perfectly in both HTML and PDF.
    :::

    Also for markdown:

    ``` markdown
    ::: {.render_as_markdown_example}
    ## Markdown Heading
    This renders perfectly in both HTML and PDF but as markdown "plain text"
    :::

    ## Diagrams

    Quarto has native support for embedding Mermaid and Graphviz diagrams. This enables you to create flowcharts, sequence diagrams, state diagrams, Gantt charts, and more using a plain text syntax inspired by markdown.

    For example, here we embed a flowchart created using Mermaid:

    ```{mermaid}
    flowchart LR
      A[Hard edge] --> B(Round edge)
      B --> C{Decision}
      C --> D[Result one]
      C --> E[Result two]
    ```

    ## Citations {#sec-citations .unnumbered .unlisted}

    @soares2014 <!-- preferred because it works with both html, latex and pdf -->

    [@soares2014] and [@knuth1984]

    Blah Blah [see @knuth1984, pp. 33-35; also @growiec2024, chap. 1]

    Blah Blah [@knuth1984, pp. 33-35, 38-39 and passim]

    ### Parenthetical citations (supporting reference)

    Recent work supports this view [@soares2014; @knuth1984].

    ### Author-only citation (when discussing the person)

    As [-@soares2014] demonstrates in their analysis...

    ### Year-only citation (when author already mentioned)

    Soares [-@soares2014] later revised this position.

    ### Page-specific references

    The key insight appears in [@soares2014, pp. 45-67].

    ### Multiple works, different pages

    This view is supported [@soares2014, p. 23; @knuth1984, pp. 156-159].

    ## Section Cross-References {#sec-crossref}

    Refer to sections like: @sec-adaptive-governance and @sec-crossref <!-- Using @-sec-REFERENCE_HEADING requires that the .qmd file contains a yml section which details the "numbering" -->

    ``` markdown
    Caveat: refering to sections with @sec-HEADINGS works only for sections with:
    ## Heading {#sec-HEADINGS}
    It does not work for sections with ".unnumbered and/or .unlisted":
    ## Heading {#sec-HEADINGS .unnumbered .unlisted}
    Furthermore the .qmd and/or .md yml settings (~ numbering have to be just right)
    ```

    ### Section Numbers

    By default, all headings in your document create a numbered section. You customize numbering depth using the number-depth option. For example, to only number sections immediately below the chapter level, use this:

    `number-depth: 2`

    Note that toc-depth is independent of number-depth (i.e. you can have unnumbered entries in the TOC if they are masked out from numbering by number-depth).

You are tasked with helping to reformat and improve the outline of the AMTAIR MA-Thesis.
This is a complex project that requires careful analysis, planning, and execution.
Follow these instructions step by step:

1. Context Comprehension:
First, carefully read and analyze the following context:

<context_files>
{{ALL_CONTEXT_FILES}}
</context_files>

<github_repository>
{{GITHUB_REPOSITORY}}
</github_repository>

2. File Explanation:

After analyzing the context, demonstrate your understanding by explaining each file, especially those in the GitHub repository and the AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmithIPYNB.md notebook.
For the notebook, explain each section and code implementatin.
Describe how each file relates to the thesis and thesis project.
Present this information in a clear, organized manner.

3. Implementation Plan Creation:
Next, review the following notes and instructions:

<notes_and_instructions>
{{improvement_planning.xml}}
</notes_and_instructions>

<notes_and_instructions2>
{{Eval-Outline_12.md}}
</notes_and_instructions2>

Based on these notes, create a comprehensive implementation plan for improving the outline.
This plan should:
a) Prioritize the order in which improvements should be made
b) Include sub-implementation plans for each aspect of improvement
c) Incorporate any additional ideas or thoughts that could help improve the outline
d) Include any reasoning that might be helpful for later outline improvement
e) Ensure strict adherence to the quarto syntax -- especially w.r.t. tasks management
f) Ensure that all contents of the new outline are absolutely coherently formatted according to the quarto syntax 
g) Include the necessary iteration procedures
h) have absolute clarity about which tasks are added where in the outline
i) update and verify the status of each task
j) ensure that every single improvment idea from 'improvement_planning.xml' is inserted (with the appropriate formatting) in the outline
k) prepare a extremely consciencous plan for improving the .ipynb notebook in order to make it fit perfectly with the thesis (and the ideal structure of the thesis)
l) Ensure that you suggest as many high quality citations -- in the appropriate format -- as possible
j) Ensure that you suggest as many high quality graphics, tables and figures -- in the appropriate format -- as possible

Present this plan in a structured, comprehensive format.

4. Outline the merging and improvement:
Using your implementation plan as a guide, carefully review the current outline:

<current_outline>
{{Friday_Outline.qmd.md}}
</current_outline>

Re-review the quarto syntax based upon which you need to reformat, update and improve the outline:
<quarto_syntax>
{{



}}

</quarto_syntax>
Insert, merge and apply the improvements step-by-step, following your plan, tracking all tasks keenly.

Before you make changes, explain your reasoning for each modification in a reasoning section in the beginning and in task format throughout.

5. Final Outline Creation:
Based on all the improvements and modifications, create the perfectly formatted, refined thesis outline without dropping ANY information contained in the current outline.
This should represent the best possible structure for the AMTAIR MA-Thesis, incorporating all the insights and improvements identified in the previous steps.

The outline also has to strictly adhere to the ideal quarto syntax and formatting as outlined in the # Quarto Syntax Section.

6. Output Format:
Present your final output in the following structure:

<file_explanations>
[Your explanations of each file and its relation to the thesis]
</file_explanations>

<syntax_explanation>
[Detail how exactly you will implement the improved quarto syntax]
</syntax_explanation>

<implementation_plan>
[Your comprehensive plan for improving the outline]
</implementation_plan>

<notebook_improvement_plan>
[Your highly detailed suggestions for how to quickly improve the .ipynb notebook such that it is the perfect complement for the thesis]
<notebook_improvement_plan>

<outline_improvement_process>
[Step-by-step explanation of how you improved the outline, including detailed reasoning]
</outline_improvement_process>

<final_outline>
[The new, hyper-detailed improved thesis outline covering every single detail of the previous draft]
</final_outline>

Remember, this task requires maximum effort and reasoning throughout.
The stakes are existential, so approach each step with the utmost care and intelligence.
Take breaks to collect your thoughts, plan far ahead and work on your final response for an equivalent of many weeks.
