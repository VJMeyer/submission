# Abstract

  The coordination crisis in AI governance presents a paradoxical challenge: unprecedented
  investment in AI safety coexists alongside fundamental coordination failures across technical,
  policy, and ethical domains. These divisions systematically increase existential risk by creating
  safety gaps, misallocating resources, and fostering inconsistent approaches to interdependent
  problems. This thesis introduces AMTAIR (Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling), a
  computational approach that addresses this coordination failure by automating the extraction of
  probabilistic world models from AI safety literature using frontier language models.
  
  The AMTAIR system implements an end-to-end pipeline that transforms unstructured text into
  interactive Bayesian networks through a novel two-stage extraction process: first capturing
  argument structure in ArgDown format, then enhancing it with probability information in
  BayesDown. This approach bridges communication gaps between stakeholders by making implicit
  models explicit, enabling comparison across different worldviews, providing a common language
  for discussing probabilistic relationships, and supporting policy evaluation across diverse scenarios.
