The paper “Current and Near-Term AI as a Potential Existential Risk Factor” maps
how today’s narrow AI systems can *indirectly* raise existential‐risk
probabilities.  
Key observations from the text and Figure 1  [oai_citation:0‡Bucknall and Dori-Hacohen - 2022 - Current and Near-Term AI as a Potential Existential Risk Factor.pdf](file-service://file-4cQokf3y36XYMg39xNxJmA):


	•	Root driver: deployment and rapid diffusion of current / near-term AI.
	•	First-tier effects (blue nodes):
– Shifts in state–state, state–corporation and state–citizen
power dynamics (arms races, lobbying, surveillance)
– AI-enabled cyber-security offence advantage
– AI-shaped information ecosystem (social-media recommender
systems)
– Direct carbon emissions from large-scale ML training
	•	Second-tier risk factors (yellow box):
– Diverted resources (political & R&D focus)
– Compromised political decision-making (polarisation,
disinformation)
	•	Terminal risk sources (red nodes): unaligned AGI, nuclear war,
engineered or natural pandemics, climate catastrophe,
global autocratic dystopia, plus the aggregate variable “Existential
Risk”.
	•	Causal edges (Table 1 colours) spell out mechanisms—e.g. cyan
“AI arms-race” links state–state tension to unaligned AGI and
diverted resources; orange “great-power war” channels tension
into nuclear and biological risks, etc.  ￼

<variable_identification>
Below are the variables extracted, grouped by role.
All use binary states unless the text clearly implies a scalar.
	•	Outcome
	•	[Existential_Risk] – overall probability of an existential
catastrophe.
	•	Risk-source variables
	•	[Unaligned_AGI_Risk] – chance of misaligned AGI catastrophe.
	•	[Nuclear_Risk] – chance of nuclear war causing existential harm.
	•	[Biological_Risk] – chance of engineered/natural pandemic at existential scale.
	•	[Environmental_Risk] – chance of runaway climate or biosphere collapse.
	•	[Stable_Repressive_Regime_Risk] – chance of global, lasting autocracy.
	•	Intermediate / mediating variables
	•	[State-State_Relations] – intensity of AI-driven interstate arms race.
	•	[Cybersecurity_Offense_Advantage] – degree to which AI tips cyber balance toward offence.
	•	[State-Corporation_Relations] – corporate lobbying / regulatory capture strength.
	•	[State-Citizen_Surveillance] – breadth & depth of AI surveillance.
	•	[Social_Media_AI_Ecosystem] – health vs manipulation of info
ecosystem.
	•	[Compromised_Political_Decisionmaking] – policy paralysis &
misinformation-induced dysfunction.
	•	[General_Diverted_Resources] – resources siphoned to AI arms race.
	•	[Malicious_AI_Use] – deliberate hostile uses (pathogen design, disinfo).
	•	[AI_Carbon_Emissions] – GHG emissions from large-scale ML.
	•	Root cause
	•	[Current_NearTerm_AI] – presence & capability level of today’s AI.

Each variable is instantiated as ["TRUE","FALSE"] (or suitably named
states) per the required metadata.

<causal_structure>
Highlights of directional links extracted from Sections 3-5:
	•	Current_NearTerm_AI → all first-tier blue nodes (power shifts,
cybersecurity, social-media ecosystem, surveillance, carbon
emissions)  ￼.
	•	Cybersecurity_Offense_Advantage → State-State_Relations
(AI-enabled cyberwarfare heightens tension)  ￼.
	•	State-State_Relations →
– Unaligned_AGI_Risk (corner-cutting in arms race)
– Nuclear_Risk & Biological_Risk (great-power war incentives)
– General_Diverted_Resources (focus on competition)  ￼.
	•	Social_Media_AI_Ecosystem → Compromised_Political_Decisionmaking
via polarisation & misinformation  ￼.
Compromised decision-making in turn elevates Biological_Risk and
Environmental_Risk by hampering collective action  ￼.
	•	State-Corporation_Relations → Compromised_Political_Decisionmaking
(lobbying, regulatory capture)  ￼.
	•	State-Citizen_Surveillance → Stable_Repressive_Regime_Risk
(AI-enabled authoritarianism)  ￼.
	•	AI_Carbon_Emissions → Environmental_Risk directly
(green edge)  ￼.
	•	Malicious_AI_Use → Biological_Risk (pathogen design) and
→ Social_Media_AI_Ecosystem (targeted disinformation)  ￼.

These form a directed acyclic graph consistent with Figure 1.

* **Metadata:** every variable line ends with valid JSON, no trailing
  commas.  
* **Indentation:** two spaces per level; deeper causes are more
  indented, forming a DAG.  
* **Variable reuse:** identical names used consistently when a cause
  appears in multiple branches (e.g., *State-State_Relations*).  
* **Coverage:** all major nodes and edges in Figure 1 are represented,
  preserving the colour-coded causal narratives.  
* **No cycles:** every path flows upward toward the single outcome
  *Existential_Risk*.  
The ArgDown representation is thus syntactically correct and faithful
to the causal model implicit in the paper.
