# Citation Identification

# PromptGeneration

First, comprehensive review of ALL files (its important to do as much of this in reasoning space / thinking tokens as possible but that key insights are printed as overview). 
From github repository, context window and prompt.
Explain each file, it's structure, contents and relation and relevance to the AMTAIR MA-Thesis etc..
Extra detailed analysis of outlines, syntax instructions (task handling/handling), colab notebook(.md) and citation files.

Second, plan how to work through the entire MAref.bib file and identify all relevant citations / literature / references for the AMTAIR MA-Thesis.

Plan how to find the most optimal way to work through the following checklist for each element:

    A) If and how the item might be relevant
    B) What claims it could be citet as supporting -- do NOT hallucinate, indicate certainty as `%` instead
    C) Where in the thesis the item should/could be reference / cited -- also note relevant context
    D) Indicate when there appears to be a clearly better alternative
    E) Provide a ISBN, DOI, PMID, arXiv ID, or ADS BibCode (maybe use websearch when applicable) for easily adding items to Zotero
    F) The suggested citation key

The overriding priority is to avoid hallucinations and errors!

Also, simoultaneously bring EVERYTHING into the absolute best quarto syntax and formatting -- following the instructions to the letter.

Third, understand the appropriate syntax for the section `# AMTAIR Thesis Relevant Literature & Citations`:

<literature_syntax>

## AMTAIR Thesis Relevant Literature & Citations

### Items from MAref.bib

<!-- Item example 1 below: (ALWAYS Format in Markdown code blocks) -->

```markdown
#### `@suggested_BibTex_Reference_Key`: 

Author(s) and year
Title

ISBN, 
DOI, 
PMID, 
arXiv ID, 
ADS BibCode

If there is a better alternative

Where in the thesis the item should/could be reference / cited (section, sub-section etc.)

What claims it could be citet as supporting

```

## New Suggested Citations

</literature_syntax>

Ensure closest possible adherence to quarto formatting instructions / best practice -- overdo it:


Full implementation of quarto syntax task management system as described in instructions:


Full implementation and strictest adherence to quarto syntax tagging and highlighting system as described in instructions:


Verify complete adherence to all points of the checklists:


Give yourself the the most detailed and rigerous, written instructions for which formatting to use when, why and how.


Lastly, --- using ONLY the relevant items --- produce the perfect, AMTAIR Thesis Relevant Literature & Citations section with items from the MAref.bib file and new citations you know about.

# Thought for 1m 3s:

Alright, this is a massive task. I need to analyze a GitHub repository for an AMTAIR (Automating the Modelling of Transformative Artificial Intelligence Risks) MA thesis. Let me break this down systematically:

First, I need to review all the files in the repository
Then analyze the MAref.bib file in detail
Create a comprehensive literature review following the specific formatting requirements

Let me start by examining the repository contents. I can see:

LICENSE (MIT License)
QUARTO_ENV_SETUP.md - environment setup instructions
GradingRubric.md - MA Essay grading rubric
LaTeX files (affidavit.tex, preamble.tex, title-page.tex)
README.md - project documentation
references.qmd - references and figure tracking
Outline_12.qmd.md - detailed thesis outline
MAref.bib - bibliography file (extensive)
_quarto.yml - Quarto configuration

Now I need to analyze each file's structure and relevance:

LICENSE: MIT License from 2025 VJMeyer - standard open source license for the thesis project
QUARTO_ENV_SETUP.md: Describes setup for Quarto-Python-R unified environment on Mac (Apple Silicon). This is crucial for the technical implementation of AMTAIR system.
GradingRubric.md: MA Essay grading rubric from Prof. Dr. Lena KÃ¤stner at University of Bayreuth. Shows the evaluation criteria for the thesis.
LaTeX files:

affidavit.tex: Declaration of academic honesty
preamble.tex: LaTeX formatting commands
title-page.tex: Thesis title page design


README.md: Comprehensive project documentation including:

Task management system
Multi-format output capabilities
Cross-referencing system
Quick start guide
Integration with ToDo-Tree


references.qmd: Contains:

Error watch section for tracking hallucinations
Figure inventory and tracking
Master citation registry
Bibliography



I'll dive deeper into the README.md's additional features. The cross-referencing system appears to be a sophisticated method for linking research components, ensuring seamless navigation through complex AI risk modeling documentation. The quick start guide likely provides immediate orientation for researchers or reviewers wanting to understand the project's core structure quickly. Integration with ToDo-Tree suggests a robust project management approach, allowing real-time tracking of research progress and potential modifications.
The references section seems meticulously designed to capture multiple research dimensions. By including an error watch section, the project demonstrates a commitment to transparency around potential AI hallucinations. The figure inventory and master citation registry indicate a systematic approach to documenting and attributing research sources.
The thesis title reveals an ambitious computational approach to modeling transformative AI risks. By developing an epistemic framework that leverages frontier AI systems, the research aims to create sophisticated policy assessment tools using Bayesian networks. The focus appears to be on navigating complex risk scenarios with computational precision.
The AMTAIR system represents an innovative end-to-end pipeline transforming unstructured arguments into interactive probabilistic models. This approach could significantly enhance our understanding of potential AI safety challenges by formalizing complex argumentative landscapes into structured, quantifiable frameworks.
Examining the MAref.bib file will be crucial for establishing the research's academic foundation, particularly in domains of AI safety, probabilistic modeling, and argument extraction methodologies.
