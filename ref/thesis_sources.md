# PromptGeneration

First, comprehensive review of ALL files (its important to do as much of this in reasoning space / thinking tokens as possible but that key insights are printed as overview). 
From github repository, context window and prompt.
Explain each file, it's structure, contents and relation and relevance to the AMTAIR MA-Thesis etc..
Extra detailed analysis of outlines, syntax instructions (task handling/handling), colab notebook(.md) and citation files.

Second, plan how to work through the MAref.bib file  merge the two outlines without removing ANY contents or information and simoultaneously updating EVERYTHING into the absolute best quarto syntax and formatting -- following the instructions to the letter.

Plan how to find the most optimal way to combine the structures of the two outlines and merge their all their contents into one.
The resulting outline should be almost the length of both outlines combined but while maintaining the same structure of chapters / level 1 headings.


Ensure closest possible adherence to quarto formatting instructions / best practice -- overdo it:


Full implementation of quarto syntax task management system as described in instructions:


Full implementation and strictest adherence to quarto syntax tagging and highlighting system as described in instructions:

Verify complete adherence to all points of the checklists:


Give yourself the the most detailed and rigerous, written instructions for which formatting to use when, why and how.


Lastly, produce the perfect, combined outline.
