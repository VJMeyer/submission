# Quarto Syntax

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

import pandas as pd
print("AMTAIR is working!")
```


## For Callouts

Quarto's native callouts work without additional packages:

::: {.callout-note}
## Important Note2
This renders perfectly in both HTML and PDF.2
:::

Also for markdown:

```markdown
::: {.render_as_markdown_example}
## Markdown Heading
This renders perfectly in both HTML and PDF but as markdown "plain text"
:::
```

## Section Cross-References {#sec-crossref}

Refer to sections like: @sec-adaptive-governance and @sec-crossref


```markdown
Caveat: refering to sections with @sec-HEADINGS works only for sections with:
## Heading {#sec-HEADINGS}
It does not work for sections with ".unnumbered and/or .unlisted":
## Heading {#sec-HEADINGS .unnumbered .unlisted}
```


## Reference or Embed Code from .ipynb files

#### Code chunks from .ipynb notebooks can be embedded in the .qmd text with:

```markdown
{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#my_code_cell_test >}}
```
#### which produces the output of executing the code cell:

{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#my_code_cell_test >}}

#### including 'echo=true' renders the code of the cell:

```markdown
{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#my_code_cell_test echo=true >}}
```

{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#my_code_cell_test echo=true >}}

  fig-scap="Five-step AMTAIR automation pipeline from PDFs to Bayesian networks" 
  fig-alt="FLOWCHART: Five-step automation pipeline workflow for AMTAIR project.
          DATA: The pipeline transforms PDFs through ArgDown, BayesDown, CSV, and HTML into Bayesian network visualizations.
          PURPOSE: Illustrates the core technical process that enables automated extraction of probabilistic models from AI safety literature.
          DETAILS: Five numbered green steps show: (1) LLM-based extraction from PDFs to ArgDown, (2) ArgDown to BayesDown completion with probabilities, (3) Extracting world-models as CSV data, (4) Software tools for data inference, and (5) Visualization of the resulting Bayesian network.
          Each step includes example outputs, with the final visualization showing a Rain-Sprinkler-Grass Wet Bayesian network with probability tables.
