### Catch ALL Potential Hallucinations


`<!-- [ ] Collect all errors and hallucinations here to be able to reference against them later and ensure none remain throught text -->`

`<!-- [ ] Keep track of all hallucinations that have been found here: -->`

1.  **Validation Metrics**: Claims of "85%+ accuracy for structural extraction" and "73% for probability capture" appear precise for what seems to be a prototype system. These need careful verification or qualification.

2.  **Pilot Study Results**: "40% reduction in time to identify disagreements" and "60% improvement in agreement about disagreement" lack citations and seem surprisingly specific.

3.  **Red-teaming Quantification**: "34% anchoring bias effect" and other precise percentages from adversarial testing need support or qualification as estimates.

4.  **Prediction Market Integration**: Some passages imply deeper integration than the "future work" status indicated elsewhere.

  abstract = {The human brain has some capabilities that the brains of other animals lack. It is to these distinctive capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. Other animals have stronger muscles or sharper claws, but we have cleverer brains. If machine brains one day come to surpass human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become very powerful. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on us humans than on the gorillas themselves, so the fate of our species then would come to depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence. But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation? To get closer to an answer to this question, we must make our way through a fascinating landscape of topics and considerations. Read the book and learn about oracles, genies, singletons; about boxing methods, tripwires, and mind crime; about humanity's cosmic endowment and differential technological development; indirect normativity, instrumental convergence, whole brain emulation and technology couplings; Malthusian economics and dystopian evolution; artificial intelligence, and biological cognitive enhancement, and collective intelligence.},
