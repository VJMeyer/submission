  fig-scap="Five-step AMTAIR automation pipeline from PDFs to Bayesian networks" 
  fig-alt="FLOWCHART: Five-step automation pipeline workflow for AMTAIR project.
          DATA: The pipeline transforms PDFs through ArgDown, BayesDown, CSV, and HTML into Bayesian network visualizations.
          PURPOSE: Illustrates the core technical process that enables automated extraction of probabilistic models from AI safety literature.
          DETAILS: Five numbered green steps show: (1) LLM-based extraction from PDFs to ArgDown, (2) ArgDown to BayesDown completion with probabilities, (3) Extracting world-models as CSV data, (4) Software tools for data inference, and (5) Visualization of the resulting Bayesian network.
          Each step includes example outputs, with the final visualization showing a Rain-Sprinkler-Grass Wet Bayesian network with probability tables.
          SOURCE: Created by the author to explain the AMTAIR methodology
