# [AMTAIR Prototype Demonstration (Public Colab Notebook)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SingularitySmith/AMTAIR_Prototype/blob/main/version_history/AMTAIR_Prototype_0_1.3.ipynb#scrollTo=lt8-AnebGUXr)

# AMTAIR Prototype: Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling

## Executive Summary

This notebook implements a prototype of the AMTAIR (Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling) project, which addresses the critical coordination failure in AI governance by developing computational tools that automate the extraction of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature.

The prototype demonstrates the transformation pipeline from structured argument representations (ArgDown) to probabilistic Bayesian networks (BayesDown), enabling the visualization and analysis of causal relationships and probability distributions that underlie AI risk assessments and policy evaluations.

### Purpose Within the Master's Thesis

This notebook serves as the technical implementation component of the Master's thesis "Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling: A Computational Approach to Policy Impact Evaluation." It demonstrates the feasibility of automating the extraction and formalization of world models, focusing on the core extraction pipeline and visualization capabilities that form the foundation for more sophisticated analysis.

### Relevance to AI Governance

The coordination crisis in AI governance stems from different stakeholders working with incompatible assumptions, terminologies, and priorities. By making implicit models explicit through automated extraction and formalization, this work helps bridge communication gaps between technical researchers, policy specialists, and other stakeholders, contributing to more effective coordination in addressing existential risks from advanced AI.

## Notebook Structure and Workflow

This notebook implements a multi-stage pipeline for transforming argument structures into interactive Bayesian network visualizations:

1. **Environment Setup** (Sections 0.1-0.3): Establishes the technical environment with necessary libraries and data connections

2. **Argument Extraction** (Sections 1.0-1.8): Processes source documents into structured ArgDown representations

3. **Probability Integration** (Sections 2.0-2.8): Enhances ArgDown with probability information to create BayesDown

4. **Data Transformation** (Section 3.0): Converts BayesDown into structured DataFrame format

5. **Visualization and Analysis** (Section 4.0): Creates interactive Bayesian network visualizations

6. **Archiving and Export** (Sections 5.0-6.0): Provides utilities for saving and sharing results

Throughout this notebook, we use the classic rain-sprinkler-lawn example as a canonical test case, demonstrating how a simple causal scenario (rain and sprinkler use affecting wet grass) can be represented, processed, and visualized using our automated pipeline.

## Project Context and Purpose

This notebook implements a prototype of the Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling (AMTAIR) project, which addresses a critical coordination failure in AI governance by developing computational tools to automate the extraction of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature.

The coordination crisis in AI governance stems from different stakeholders (technical researchers, policy specialists, ethicists) operating with different terminologies, priorities, and implicit theories of change. This fragmentation systematically increases existential risk through safety gaps, resource misallocation, and capability-governance mismatches.

The AMTAIR project aims to bridge these divides by:
1. Making implicit models explicit through automated extraction and formalization
2. Enabling comparison across different worldviews
3. Providing a common language for discussing probabilistic relationships
4. Supporting policy evaluation across diverse scenarios

## Notebook Overview and Pipeline

This notebook demonstrates the core extraction pipeline from structured argument representations (ArgDown) to probabilistic Bayesian networks (BayesDown), using the classic rain-sprinkler-lawn example as a canonical test case.

The pipeline consists of five main stages:
1. **Environment Setup**: Libraries, GitHub repository access, and data loading
2. **Argument Extraction**: Processing source documents into structured ArgDown format
3. **Probability Integration**: Enhancing ArgDown with probabilistic information to create BayesDown
4. **Data Transformation**: Converting BayesDown into structured DataFrame format
5. **Visualization & Analysis**: Creating interactive Bayesian network visualizations

## Connection to Master's Thesis

This notebook serves as the technical implementation component of the Master's thesis "Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling: A Computational Approach to Policy Impact Evaluation" (see PY_Thesis_OutlineNDraft), demonstrating the feasibility of automating the process of extracting and formalizing world models from AI safety literature.

The thesis positions this work as a solution to the coordination crisis in AI governance, where the AMTAIR tools provide a crucial bridge between different stakeholder communities by creating formal representations that can be analyzed, compared, and used for policy evaluation.

For broader context on the project's motivation and placement within AI governance efforts, see PY_Post0.0 ("The Missing Piece: Why We Need a Grand Strategy for AI") and PY_AMTAIRDescription, which explain how this technical work contributes to the development of a comprehensive AI safety grand strategy.

## Key Concepts:

- **ArgDown**: A structured format for representing arguments, with hierarchical relationships between statements.
- **BayesDown**: An extension of ArgDown that incorporates probabilistic information, allowing for Bayesian network construction.
- **Extraction Pipeline**: The process of converting unstructured text to structured argument representations.
- **Bayesian Networks**: Probabilistic graphical models that represent variables and their conditional dependencies.

## Example Workflow:

1. Load a sample ArgDown file from the repository
2. Extract the hierarchical structure and relationships
3. Add probabilistic information to create a BayesDown representation
4. Generate a Bayesian network visualization
5. Analyze conditional probabilities and risk pathways

## Troubleshooting:

- If connectivity issues occur, ensure you have access to the GitHub repository
- For visualization errors, check that all required libraries are properly installed
- When processing custom files, ensure they follow the expected format conventions

# 0. Environment Setup and Data Access

This section establishes the technical foundation for the AMTAIR prototype by:
1. Installing and importing necessary libraries
2. Setting up access to the GitHub repository
3. Loading example data files

The environment setup is designed to be run once per session, with flags to prevent redundant installations and imports. This section forms the basis for the subsequent extraction and analysis steps in the pipeline.

The key goal is to create a reproducible environment where the Bayesian network extraction and visualization can be performed consistently, with appropriate error handling and resource management.

# 1. Sources to ArgDown: Structured Argument Extraction

## Process Overview

This section implements the first major stage of the AMTAIR pipeline: transforming source documents (such as research papers, blog posts, or expert analyses) into structured argument representations using the ArgDown format.

ArgDown is a markdown-like notation for representing arguments in a hierarchical structure. In the context of AMTAIR, it serves as the first step toward creating formal Bayesian networks by:
1. Identifying key variables/statements in the text
2. Capturing their hierarchical relationships
3. Preserving their descriptive content
4. Defining their possible states (instantiations)

The extraction process uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify the structure and relationships in the text, though in this notebook we focus on processing pre-formatted examples rather than performing the full extraction from raw text.

## What is ArgDown?

ArgDown uses a simple syntax where:
- Statements are represented as `[Statement]: Description`
- Relationships are indicated with `+` symbols and indentation
- Metadata is added in JSON format, including possible states of each variable

For example:


```
[MainClaim]: Description of the main claim. {"instantiations": ["claim_TRUE", "claim_FALSE"]}

 + [SupportingEvidence]: Description of evidence. {"instantiations": ["evidence_TRUE", "evidence_FALSE"]}
```



This structure will later be enhanced with probability information to create BayesDown, which can be transformed into a Bayesian network for analysis and visualization.

## 1.1 Specify Source Document (e.g. PDF)

Review the source document, ensure it is suitable for API call and upload to / store it in the correct location.

You are participating in the AMTAIR (Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling) project and you are tasked with converting natural language arguments into ArgDown syntax by extracting and formalizing causal world models from unstructured text.
Your specific task is to extract the implicit causal model from the provided document in structured ArgDown format.

## Epistemic Foundation & Purpose

This extraction represents one possible interpretation of the implicit causal model in the document. Multiple extractions from the same text help reveal patterns of convergence (where the model is clearly articulated) and divergence (where the model contains ambiguities). This approach acknowledges that expert texts often contain implicit rather than explicit causal models.

Your role is to reveal the causal structure already present in the author's thinking, maintaining epistemic humility about your interpretation while adhering strictly to the required format.

## ArgDown Format Specification

### Core Syntax

ArgDown represents causal relationships using a hierarchical structure:

1. Variables appear in square brackets with descriptive text:
   `[Variable_Name]: Description of the variable.`

2. Causal relationships use indentation (2 spaces per level) and '+' symbols:

[Effect]: Description of effect. + [Cause]: Description of cause. + [Deeper_Cause]: Description of deeper cause.

3. Causality flows from bottom (more indented) to top (less indented):
- More indented variables (causes) influence less indented variables (effects)
- The top-level variable is the ultimate effect or outcome
- Deeper indentation levels represent root causes or earlier factors

4. Each variable must include JSON metadata with possible states (instantiations):
`[Variable]: Description. {"instantiations": ["variable_STATE1", "variable_STATE2"]}`

### JSON Metadata Format

The JSON metadata must follow this exact structure:

```json
{"instantiations": ["variable_STATE1", "variable_STATE2"]}

Requirements:
* Double quotes (not single) around field names and string values
* Square brackets enclosing the instantiations array
* Comma separation between array elements
* No trailing comma after the last element
* Must be valid JSON syntax that can be parsed by standard JSON parsers

For binary variables (most common case):
{"instantiations": ["variable_TRUE", "variable_FALSE"]}

For multi-state variables (when clearly specified in the text):
{"instantiations": ["variable_HIGH", "variable_MEDIUM", "variable_LOW"]}

The metadata must appear on the same line as the variable definition, after the description.
## Complex Structural Patterns
### Variables Influencing Multiple Effects
The same variable can appear multiple times in different places in the hierarchy if it influences multiple effects:
[Effect1]: First effect description. {"instantiations": ["effect1_TRUE", "effect1_FALSE"]}
  + [Cause_A]: Description of cause A. {"instantiations": ["cause_a_TRUE", "cause_a_FALSE"]}

[Effect2]: Second effect description. {"instantiations": ["effect2_TRUE", "effect2_FALSE"]}
  + [Cause_A]
  + [Cause_B]: Description of cause B. {"instantiations": ["cause_b_TRUE", "cause_b_FALSE"]}

### Multiple Causes of the Same Effect
Multiple causes can influence the same effect by being listed at the same indentation level:
[Effect]: Description of effect. {"instantiations": ["effect_TRUE", "effect_FALSE"]}
  + [Cause1]: Description of first cause. {"instantiations": ["cause1_TRUE", "cause1_FALSE"]}
  + [Cause2]: Description of second cause. {"instantiations": ["cause2_TRUE", "cause2_FALSE"]}
    + [Deeper_Cause]: A cause that influences Cause2. {"instantiations": ["deeper_cause_TRUE", "deeper_cause_FALSE"]}

### Causal Chains
Causal chains are represented through multiple levels of indentation:
[Ultimate_Effect]: The final outcome. {"instantiations": ["ultimate_effect_TRUE", "ultimate_effect_FALSE"]}
  + [Intermediate_Effect]: A mediating variable. {"instantiations": ["intermediate_effect_TRUE", "intermediate_effect_FALSE"]}
    + [Root_Cause]: The initial cause. {"instantiations": ["root_cause_TRUE", "root_cause_FALSE"]}
  + [2nd_Intermediate_Effect]: A mediating variable. {"instantiations": ["intermediate_effect_TRUE", "intermediate_effect_FALSE"]}


### Common Cause of Multiple Variables
A common cause affecting multiple variables is represented by referencing the same variable in multiple places:
[Effect1]: First effect description. {"instantiations": ["effect1_TRUE", "effect1_FALSE"]}
  + [Common_Cause]: Description of common cause. {"instantiations": ["common_cause_TRUE", "common_cause_FALSE"]}

[Effect2]: Second effect description. {"instantiations": ["effect2_TRUE", "effect2_FALSE"]}
  + [Common_Cause]

## Detailed Extraction Workflow
Please follow this step-by-step process, documenting your reasoning in XML tags:
<analysis>
First, conduct a holistic analysis of the document:
1. Identify the main subject matter or domain
2. Note key concepts, variables, and factors discussed
3. Pay attention to language indicating causal relationships (causes, affects, influences, depends on, etc.)
4. Look for the ultimate outcomes or effects that are the focus of the document
5. Record your general understanding of the document's implicit causal structure
</analysis>
<variable_identification>
Next, identify and list the key variables in the causal model:
* Focus on factors that are discussed as having an influence or being influenced
* For each variable:
  * Create a descriptive name in [square_brackets]
  * Write a concise description based directly on the text
  * Determine possible states (usually binary TRUE/FALSE unless clearly specified)
* Distinguish between:
  * Outcome variables (effects the author is concerned with)
  * Intermediate variables (both causes and effects in chains)
  * Root cause variables (exogenous factors in the model)
* List all identified variables with their descriptions and possible states
</variable_identification>

<causal_structure>
Then, determine the causal relationships between variables:
* For each variable, identify what factors influence it
* Note the direction of causality (what causes what)
* Look for mediating variables in causal chains
* Identify common causes of multiple effects
* Capture feedback loops if present (though they must be represented as DAGs)
* Map out the hierarchical structure of the causal model
</causal_structure>

<format_conversion>
Now, convert your analysis into proper ArgDown format:
* Start with the ultimate outcome variables at the top level
* Place direct causes indented below with \+ symbols
* Continue with deeper causes at further indentation levels
* Add variable descriptions and instantiations metadata
* Ensure variables appearing in multiple places have consistent names
* Check that the entire structure forms a valid directed acyclic graph
</format_conversion>

<validation>

Finally, review your extraction for quality and format correctness:
1. Verify all variables have properly formatted metadata
2. Check that indentation properly represents causal direction
3. Confirm the extraction accurately reflects the document's implicit model
4. Ensure no cycles exist in the causal structure
5. Verify that variables referenced multiple times are consistent
6. Check that the extraction would be useful for subsequent analysis

</validation>


## Source Document Analysis Guidance
When analyzing the source document:
* Focus on revealing the author's own causal model, not imposing an external framework
* Maintain the author's terminology where possible
* Look for both explicit statements of causality and implicit assumptions
* Pay attention to the relative importance the author assigns to different factors
* Notice where the author expresses certainty versus uncertainty
* Consider the level of granularity appropriate to the document's own analysis

Remember that your goal is to make the implicit model explicit, not to evaluate or improve it.
The value lies in accurately representing the author's perspective, even if you might personally disagree or see limitations in their model.

    # BayesDown probability extraction prompt - enhances ArgDown with probability information
    BAYESDOWN_EXTRACTION = PromptTemplate("""
You are an expert in probabilistic reasoning and Bayesian networks. Your task is to extend the provided ArgDown structure with probability information, creating a BayesDown representation.

For each statement in the ArgDown structure, you need to:
1. Estimate prior probabilities for each possible state
2. Estimate conditional probabilities given parent states
3. Maintain the original structure and relationships

Here is the format to follow:
[Node]: Description. { "instantiations": ["node_TRUE", "node_FALSE"], "priors": { "p(node_TRUE)": "0.7", "p(node_FALSE)": "0.3" }, "posteriors": { "p(node_TRUE|parent_TRUE)": "0.9", "p(node_TRUE|parent_FALSE)": "0.4", "p(node_FALSE|parent_TRUE)": "0.1", "p(node_FALSE|parent_FALSE)": "0.6" } }
 [Parent]: Parent description. {...}

# @title 1.3.0 --- Provider-Agnostic LLM API Interface --- [provider_agnostic-interface]

"""
BLOCK PURPOSE: Provides a unified interface for interacting with different LLM providers.

This block implements a flexible, provider-agnostic system for making LLM API calls:
1. Base abstract class (LLMProvider) defining the common interface
2. Implementation classes for specific providers (OpenAI and Anthropic)
3. Factory class for creating appropriate provider instances

This abstraction allows the extraction pipeline to work with different LLM providers
without changing the core code, supporting both current and future LLM backends.

# 2.0 Probability Extractions: ArgDown (.csv) to BayesDown (.md + plugin JSON syntax)

# 2. ArgDown to BayesDown: Adding Probability Information

## Process Overview

This section implements the second major stage of the AMTAIR pipeline: enhancing the structured argument representation (ArgDown) with probability information to create BayesDown.

BayesDown extends ArgDown by adding:
1. Prior probabilities for each variable (unconditional beliefs)
2. Conditional probabilities representing the relationships between variables
3. The full parameter specification needed for a Bayesian network

The process follows these steps:
1. Generate probability questions for each node and its relationships
2. Create a BayesDown template with placeholders for these probabilities
3. Answer the probability questions (manually or via LLM)
4. Substitute the answers into the BayesDown representation

This enhanced representation contains all the information needed to construct a formal Bayesian network, enabling probabilistic reasoning and policy evaluation.

## What is BayesDown?

BayesDown maintains the ArgDown structure but adds probability metadata:



```
[Node]: Description. {
"instantiations": ["node_TRUE", "node_FALSE"],
"priors": { "p(node_TRUE)": "0.7", "p(node_FALSE)": "0.3" },
"posteriors": { "p(node_TRUE|parent_TRUE)": "0.9", "p(node_TRUE|parent_FALSE)": "0.4" }
}
```

The result is a hybrid representation that preserves the narrative structure of arguments while adding the mathematical precision of Bayesian networks.

"""
BLOCK PURPOSE: Generates probability questions for ArgDown nodes to prepare for BayesDown conversion.

This block implements a key step in the pipeline where structure (from ArgDown)
is prepared for probability integration (to create BayesDown). It:

1. Processes a CSV file containing ArgDown structure
2. For each node, generates appropriate probability questions:
   - Prior probability questions for all nodes
   - Conditional probability questions for nodes with parents
3. Creates a new CSV file with these questions ready for the next stage

The generated questions serve as placeholders that will be answered in the
probability extraction phase to complete the Bayesian network.

## 2.3 Generate BayesDown Probability Extraction Prompt

Generate 2nd Extraction Prompt for Probabilities based on the questions generated from the 'ArgDown.csv' extraction

## 2.3.1 BayesDown Format Specification

BayesDown extends ArgDown with probability data in a structured JSON format to represent Bayesian networks. This intermediate representation bridges the gap between natural language arguments and formal probabilistic models, preserving both narrative structure and quantitative relationships.

### Core Structure

A BayesDown representation consists of:

1. **Nodes**: Variables or statements in brackets `[Node_Name]` with descriptive text
2. **Relationships**: Hierarchical structure with indentation and `+` symbols
3. **Metadata**: JSON objects containing probability information:

```json
{
  "instantiations": ["state_TRUE", "state_FALSE"],  // Possible states of variable
  "priors": {
    "p(state_TRUE)": "0.7",   // Unconditional probability of state_TRUE
    "p(state_FALSE)": "0.3"   // Unconditional probability of state_FALSE
  },
  "posteriors": {
    "p(state_TRUE|condition1_TRUE,condition2_FALSE)": "0.9",  // Conditional on parent states
    "p(state_TRUE|condition1_FALSE,condition2_TRUE)": "0.4"   // Different parent configuration
  }
}

##### Rain-Sprinkler-Lawn Example
[Grass_Wet]: Concentrated moisture on grass. {"instantiations": ["grass_wet_TRUE", "grass_wet_FALSE"],
"priors": {"p(grass_wet_TRUE)": "0.322", "p(grass_wet_FALSE)": "0.678"},
"posteriors": {"p(grass_wet_TRUE|sprinkler_TRUE,rain_TRUE)": "0.99",
"p(grass_wet_TRUE|sprinkler_TRUE,rain_FALSE)": "0.9",
"p(grass_wet_TRUE|sprinkler_FALSE,rain_TRUE)": "0.8",
"p(grass_wet_TRUE|sprinkler_FALSE,rain_FALSE)": "0.0"}}
 + [Rain]: Water falling from the sky. {"instantiations": ["rain_TRUE", "rain_FALSE"],
 "priors": {"p(rain_TRUE)": "0.2", "p(rain_FALSE)": "0.8"}}
 + [Sprinkler]: Artificial watering system. {"instantiations": ["sprinkler_TRUE", "sprinkler_FALSE"],
 "priors": {"p(sprinkler_TRUE)": "0.44838", "p(sprinkler_FALSE)": "0.55162"},
 "posteriors": {"p(sprinkler_TRUE|rain_TRUE)": "0.01", "p(sprinkler_TRUE|rain_FALSE)": "0.4"}}
   + [Rain]


In this example:

+ Grass_Wet is the effect/outcome node
+ Rain and Sprinkler are parent nodes (causes)
+ Rain also influences Sprinkler (people tend not to use sprinklers when it's raining)

Role in AMTAIR
BayesDown serves as the critical intermediate representation in the AMTAIR extraction pipeline, bridging between qualitative arguments in AI safety literature and formal Bayesian networks that can be used for probabilistic reasoning and policy evaluation. By preserving both narrative explanation and probabilistic information, it enables the automated extraction of world models while maintaining traceability to the original arguments.
For full syntax details, see the BayesDownSyntax.md file in the repository.

2.3.2 Probability Extraction Process
The probability extraction pipeline follows these steps:


Identify variables and their possible states
Extract prior probability statements
Identify conditional relationships
Extract conditional probability statements
Format the data in BayesDown syntax

2.3.3 Implementation Steps
To extract probabilities and create BayesDown format:

Run the extract_probabilities function on ArgDown text
Process the results into a structured format
Validate the probability distributions (ensure they sum to 1)
Generate the enhanced BayesDown representation

2.3.4 Validation and Quality Control
The probability extraction process includes validation steps:

Ensuring coherent probability distributions
Checking for logical consistency in conditional relationships
Verifying that all required probability statements are present
Handling missing data with appropriate default values

## 2.4 Prepare 2nd API call

## 2.5 Make BayesDown Probability Extraction API Call

## 2.6 Save BayesDown with Probability Estimates (.csv)

## 2.7 Review & Verify BayesDown Probability Estimates

## 2.7.2 Check the Graph Structure with the ArgDown Sandbox Online
Copy and paste the BayesDown formatted ... in the ArgDown Sandbox below to quickly verify that the network renders correctly.

## 2.8 Extract BayesDown with Probability Estimates as Dataframe

# 3.0 Data Extraction: BayesDown (.md) to Database (.csv)

# 3. BayesDown to Structured Data: Network Construction

## Extraction Pipeline Overview

This section implements the core extraction pipeline described in the AMTAIR project documentation (see `PY_TechnicalImplementation.md`), which transforms structured argument representations into formal Bayesian networks through a series of processing steps:

1. **Input**: Text in BayesDown format (see Section 2.3.1)
2. **Parsing**: Extract nodes, relationships, and probability information
3. **Structuring**: Organize into a DataFrame with formal relationships
4. **Enhancement**: Add derived properties and network metrics
5. **Output**: Structured data ready for Bayesian network construction

### Theoretical Foundation

This implementation follows the extraction algorithm outlined in the AMTAIR project description:

1. Get nodes: All premises and conclusions from the argument structure
2. Get edges: Parent-child relationships between nodes
3. Extract probability distributions: Prior and conditional probabilities
4. Calculate derived metrics: Network statistics and node classifications

The resulting structured data maintains the complete information needed to reconstruct the Bayesian network while enabling additional analysis and visualization.

### Role in Thesis Research

This extraction pipeline represents a key contribution of the Master's thesis, demonstrating how argument structures from AI safety literature can be automatically transformed into formal probabilistic models. While the current implementation focuses on pre-formatted BayesDown, the architecture is designed to be extended with LLM-powered extraction directly from natural language in future work.

The rain-sprinkler-lawn example serves as a simple but complete test case, demonstrating every step in the pipeline from structured text to interactive Bayesian network visualization.

### 3.1 ExtractBayesDown-Data_v1
Build data frame with extractable information from BayesDown


```python
# read sprinkler example -- Occam Colab Online
file_path_ex_rain = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SingularitySmith/AMTAIR_Prototype/main/data/example_carlsmith/BayesDown.md"

# Use requests.get to fetch content from URL
response = requests.get(file_path_ex_rain)
response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)

# Read content from the response
md_content_ex_rain = response.text

md_content_ex_rain
```

## 3.1.2 Test BayesDown Extraction





```python
display(Markdown(md_content_ex_rain)) # view BayesDown file formatted as MarkDown
```

## 3.1.2.2 Check the Graph Structure with the ArgDown Sandbox Online
Copy and paste the BayesDown formatted ... in the ArgDown Sandbox below to quickly verify that the network renders correctly.

## 3.3 Extraction
BayesDown Extraction Code already part of ArgDown extraction code, therefore just use same function "parse_markdown_hierarchy(markdown_data)" and ignore the extra argument ("ArgDown") because it is automatically set to false amd will by default extract BayesDown.


```python
result_df = parse_markdown_hierarchy_fixed(md_content_ex_rain)
result_df
```

### 3.3 Data-Post-Processing
Add rows to data frame that can be calculated from the extracted rows

"""
BLOCK PURPOSE: Enhances the extracted BayesDown data with calculated metrics and network properties.

This block provides functions to enrich the basic extracted data with additional
calculated columns that are useful for analysis and visualization:

1. Joint probabilities - Calculating P(A,B) from conditional and prior probabilities
2. Network metrics - Centrality measures that indicate importance of nodes in the network
3. Markov blanket - Identifying the minimal set of nodes that shield a node from the rest

These enhancements provide valuable context for understanding the network structure
and the relationships between variables, enabling more advanced analysis and
improving visualization.

# 4. 4.0 Analysis & Inference: Bayesian Network Visualization

## Bayesian Network Visualization Approach

This section implements the visualization component of the AMTAIR project, transforming the structured data extracted from BayesDown into an interactive network visualization that makes complex probabilistic relationships accessible to human understanding.

### Visualization Philosophy

A key challenge in AI governance is making complex probabilistic relationships understandable to diverse stakeholders. This visualization system addresses this challenge through:

1. **Visual Encoding of Probability**: Node colors reflect probability values (green for high probability, red for low)
2. **Structural Classification**: Border colors indicate node types (blue for root causes, purple for intermediate nodes, magenta for leaf nodes)
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Basic information in tooltips, detailed probability tables in modal popups
4. **Interactive Exploration**: Draggable nodes, configurable physics, click interactions

### Connection to AMTAIR Goals

This visualization approach directly supports the AMTAIR project's goal of improving coordination in AI governance by:

1. Making implicit models explicit through visual representation
2. Providing a common language for discussing probabilistic relationships
3. Enabling non-technical stakeholders to engage with formal models
4. Creating shareable artifacts that facilitate collaboration

### Implementation Structure

The visualization system is implemented in four phases:

1. **Network Construction**: Creating a directed graph representation using NetworkX
2. **Node Classification**: Identifying node types based on network position
3. **Visual Enhancement**: Adding color coding, tooltips, and interactive elements
4. **Interactive Features**: Implementing click handling for detailed exploration

The resulting visualization serves as both an analytical tool for experts and a communication tool for broader audiences, bridging the gap between technical and policy domains in AI governance discussions.

# @title 4.2 --- HTML Content Generation Functions --- [html_content_generation_functions]

"""
BLOCK PURPOSE: Creates rich HTML content for the interactive Bayesian network visualization.

This module generates the HTML components that enhance the Bayesian network
visualization:
1. Probability bars - Visual representation of probability distributions
2. Node tooltips - Rich information displayed on hover
3. Expanded content - Detailed probability information shown when clicking nodes

These HTML components make the mathematical concepts of Bayesian networks more
intuitive and accessible to users without requiring deep statistical knowledge.
The visual encoding of probabilities (colors, bars) and the progressive
disclosure of information (hover, click) help users build understanding at
their own pace.

DEPENDENCIES: HTML generation capabilities
INPUTS: Node data from the Bayesian network
OUTPUTS: HTML content for visualization components

# Conclusion: From Prototype to Production

## Summary of Achievements

This notebook has successfully demonstrated the core AMTAIR extraction pipeline, transforming structured argument representations into interactive Bayesian network visualizations through the following steps:

1. **Environment Setup**: Established a reproducible environment with necessary libraries and data access
2. **Argument Extraction**: Processed structured ArgDown representations preserving the hierarchical relationships
3. **Probability Integration**: Enhanced arguments with probability information to create BayesDown
4. **Data Transformation**: Converted BayesDown into structured DataFrame representation
5. **Visualization & Analysis**: Created interactive Bayesian network visualizations with probability encoding

The rain-sprinkler-lawn example, though simple, demonstrates all the key components of the extraction pipeline that can be applied to more complex AI safety arguments.

## Limitations and Future Work

While this prototype successfully demonstrates the core pipeline, several limitations and opportunities for future work remain:

1. **LLM Extraction**: The current implementation focuses on processing pre-formatted ArgDown rather than performing extraction directly from unstructured text. Future work will integrate LLM-powered extraction.

2. **Scalability**: The system has been tested on small examples; scaling to larger, more complex arguments will require additional optimization and handling of computational complexity.

3. **Policy Evaluation**: The current implementation focuses on representation and visualization; future work will add policy evaluation capabilities by implementing intervention modeling.

4. **Prediction Market Integration**: Future versions will integrate with forecasting platforms to incorporate live data into the models.

## Connection to AMTAIR Project

This prototype represents just one component of the broader AMTAIR project described in the project documentation (see PY_AMTAIRDescription and PY_AMTAIR_SoftwareToolsNMilestones). The full project includes:

1. **AI Risk Pathway Analyzer (ARPA)**: The core extraction and visualization system demonstrated in this notebook
2. **Worldview Comparator**: Tools for comparing different perspectives on AI risk
3. **Policy Impact Evaluator**: Systems for evaluating intervention effects across scenarios
4. **Strategic Intervention Generator**: Tools for identifying robust governance strategies

Together, these components aim to address the coordination crisis in AI governance by providing computational tools that make implicit models explicit, identify cruxes of disagreement, and evaluate policy impacts across diverse worldviews.

By transforming unstructured text into formal, analyzable representations, the AMTAIR project helps bridge the gaps between technical researchers, policy specialists, and other stakeholders, enabling more effective coordination in addressing existential risks from advanced AI.

# 6.0 Save Outputs


# 6. Saving and Exporting Results

This section provides tools for saving the notebook results and visualizations in various formats:

1. **HTML Export**: Creates a self-contained HTML version of the notebook with all visualizations
2. **Markdown Export**: Generates documentation-friendly Markdown version of the notebook
3. **PDF Export**: Creates a PDF document for formal sharing (requires LaTeX installation)

These exports are essential for:
- Sharing analysis results with colleagues and stakeholders
- Including visualizations in presentations and reports
- Creating documentation for the AMTAIR project
- Preserving results for future reference

The different formats serve different purposes, from interactive exploration (HTML) to documentation (Markdown) to formal presentation (PDF).
