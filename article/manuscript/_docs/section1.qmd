# Introduction

This is a booooook created from markdown and executable code.

See [@knuth84] and @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.

Regular markdown and $E=mc^2$ equations.

\begin{align}
a &= b + c \\
d &= e * f
\end{align}

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{python}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{python}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).


```{python}
1 + 1
```
