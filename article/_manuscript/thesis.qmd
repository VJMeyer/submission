abstract: |
  The coordination crisis in AI governance presents a paradoxical challenge: unprecedented
  investment in AI safety coexists alongside fundamental coordination failures across technical,
  policy, and ethical domains. These divisions systematically increase existential risk by creating
  safety gaps, misallocating resources, and fostering inconsistent approaches to interdependent
  problems. This thesis introduces AMTAIR (Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling), a
  computational approach that addresses this coordination failure by automating the extraction of
  probabilistic world models from AI safety literature using frontier language models.
  
  The AMTAIR system implements an end-to-end pipeline that transforms unstructured text into
  interactive Bayesian networks through a novel two-stage extraction process: first capturing
  argument structure in ArgDown format, then enhancing it with probability information in
  BayesDown. This approach bridges communication gaps between stakeholders by making implicit
  models explicit, enabling comparison across different worldviews, providing a common language
  for discussing probabilistic relationships, and supporting policy evaluation across diverse scenarios.
plain-language-summary: |
  This thesis addresses coordination problems in AI safety by creating tools that automatically
  extract and formalize the assumptions and models underlying different approaches to AI governance.
  By transforming complex arguments into interactive visualizations showing relationships and
  probabilities, AMTAIR helps bridge communication gaps between technical researchers, policy
  specialists, and other stakeholders working to address risks from advanced AI.
key-points:
  - A novel extraction pipeline transforms argument structures into Bayesian networks through a two-stage process
  - Interactive visualizations make complex probabilistic relationships accessible to diverse stakeholders
  - Formal representation enables comparison across different worldviews and assumptions
  - The approach addresses coordination failures by creating a common language for AI risk assessment

## Introduction

```{r}
eruptions <- c(1492, 1585, 1646, 1677, 1712, 1949, 1971, 2021)
n_eruptions <- length(eruptions)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-timeline
#| fig-cap: Timeline of recent earthquakes on La Palma
#| fig-alt: An event plot of the years of the last 8 eruptions on La Palma.
#| fig-height: 1.5
#| fig-width: 6
par(mar = c(3, 1, 1, 1) + 0.1)
plot(eruptions, rep(0, n_eruptions), 
  pch = "|", axes = FALSE)
axis(1)
box()
```

```{r}
#| output: false
avg_years_between_eruptions <- mean(diff(eruptions[-n_eruptions]))
avg_years_between_eruptions
```

Based on data up to and including 1971, eruptions on La Palma happen every `{r} round(avg_years_between_eruptions, 1)` years on average.

Studies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as @marrero2019, have proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir (10-20km depth).

Eight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s (@fig-timeline).

Data and methods are discussed in @sec-data-methods.

Let $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution

$$
p(x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x}}{x !}
$$ {#eq-poisson}

where $\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.
