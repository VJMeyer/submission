You are tasked with conducting a comprehensive review of all documents in the context window, including all files accessible through the GitHub integration.
Your goal is to demonstrate a thorough understanding of each file and its relevance to the AMTAIR project and the associated Master's thesis.
Make sure to understand the setup with the Quarto book AND manuscript properly!
Begin by carefully reading and analyzing the following:
<context_window>
{{
ALL_FILES_IN_CONTEXT_WINDOW
}}
</context_window>
Next, review all files accessible through the GitHub integration:
<github_files>
{{
ALL_GITHUB_FILES
}}
</github_files>
For each file, including those in the context window and GitHub integration, provide the following in a table:
1. File name
2. A one-paragraph description/summary of the file's current contents
3. A one-paragraph explanation of the file's structure
4. A one-paragraph explanation of how and why the file's contents are relevant for the AMTAIR project and the Master's thesis (if the file appears to be a placeholder, speculated as to the intended file)

Before writing your final answer, use a <scratchpad> to organize your extensive thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary elements for each file.

Your final output markdown formatted table has to contain:
5. File Name
6. One-paragraph summary
7. One-paragraph explanation of structure
8. One-paragraph explanation of (intended) relevance
[Repeat the above structure for each file]
Afterwards, pay special attention to any .ipynb notebook (available as .md).
For this file, provide an additional, detailed analysis, including:
9. A thorough breakdown of each section or cell in the notebook
10. An explanation of the code and its purpose
11. A discussion of the notebook, code and workflow structure including any data analysis or visualizations present
12. An assessment of how the notebook ties in with and contributes to the overall project goals
For the notebook and code:
13. Notebook File Name
14. Outline / Structure of the Notebook
15. A list and description of all files called/loaded/used and/or outputted/saved
16. A detailed analysis for the .ipynb notebook, covering all points mentioned in the instructions


Afterwards, we need to update, revise and improve the Thesis Title Page.

Here are screenshots of the current (.html) "title-pages" and of an approximation of what the title page is supposed to look like:


Write a truly comprehensive plan that considers ALL possible details of how to best implement this given the current setup.

Iterate, reflect and improve the plan at least 3 times.

Then print the changes that need to be made to achieve the objectives.
