Focus on the underlying, core problem of the conflict between "exponential expansion" of exploring and explaining topics vs. writing a MA thesis which has a coherent "trail of thought" and the "attention which follow the writing sequentially".

Crucial questions which each need to be addressed specifically:

What about the underlying, core problem of the conflict between "exponential expansion" of exploring and explaining topics vs. writing a MA thesis which has a coherent "trail of thought" and the "attention which follow the writing sequentially"?

What about the question of how to find/formulate the core research question?

What about the central thesis?

What are ways of deciding where/how to start the thesis?

What workflows can help finding the best possible outline and what ideas to include / leave out?

What are the most productive ways of conceptualizing the "map of knowledge" / "web/network of understanding" vs. the sequential form-factor required by a thesis?

What are the most productive ways of conceptualizing the relationship between attention (e.g. while reading/following along) and understanding/knowledge (connecting concepts to previous knowledge, building up blocks of understanding from smaller chunks of information... optimal order of information etc.)?

What are the best practices for explaining a web of knowledge in a (necessarily) sequential way?

How can LLMs be used most effectively, given these challenges/considerations (e.g. practical application in iteration loops etc.)?

What software mitigations/solutions help addressing the core trade-offs (e.g. links, glossaries, footnotes, comments ...)?

How should can one think productively about the possibilities from "new" formats (e.g. interactive html / websites etc. over PDF)?

What are the best practices for deciding what to include, given that a thesis comes with strict limitations on the length?

How to think about the trade-off between comprehensiveness and "easy to follow / clear progression of arguments / conciseness?

After discussing all these questions in detail, as well as the underlying points/vibe, discuss possible ways of accounting and working around/including all the above in the software workflow for writing a MA Thesis with the help of LLMs.
I have numerous notes, drafts, todo lists, improvement ideas, versions of outlines, etc. please suggest the best possible setups/workflows to produce the best possible master's thesis (specifically iteration/prompting loops involving LLM's such as yourself).
