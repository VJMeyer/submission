Earthquake data is continually collected and published by the Instituto Geográphico Nacional (IGN). ...\nplain-language-summary: |\n  Earthquake data for the island of La Palma from the September 2021 eruption is found ...\nkey-points:\n  - A web scraping script was developed to pull data from the Instituto Geogràphico Nacional into a machine-readable form for analysis\n  - Earthquake events on La Palma are consistent with the presence of both mantle and crustal reservoirs.\ndate: last-modified\nbibliography: ref/MAref.bib\ncitation:\n  container-title: Earth and Space Science\nnumber-sections: true\n---\n\n<!-- [ ] Figure out Outline to Outline to Draft Workflow -->\n\n<!-- [ ] Figure out Thesis \"styling\" (book vs manuscript) -->\n<!-- [ ] Setup reliable \"save as PDF\" -->\n<!-- [ ] Setup \"save as LaTeX\" -->\n<!-- [ ] Adapt LaTeX / PDF based on (journal) template -->\n\n## Introduction\n\n<!-- [ ]: Clean up the introduction -->\n\n\n<!-- [ ]: Test Quarto-Code-Links: https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/components.html#code-links -->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n# [ ]: Configure the Quarto Manuscript options: https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/components.html#including-notebooks\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\neruptions <- c(1492, 1585, 1646, 1677, 1712, 1949, 1971, 2021)\nn_eruptions <- length(eruptions)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {#cell-fig-timeline .cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\npar(mar = c(3, 1, 1, 1) + 0.1)\nplot(eruptions, rep(0, n_eruptions), \n  pch = \"|\", axes = FALSE)\naxis(1)\nbox()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Timeline of recent earthquakes on La Palma](thesis_files/figure-html/fig-timeline-1.png){#fig-timeline fig-alt='An event plot of the years of the last 8 eruptions on La Palma.' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\navg_years_between_eruptions <- mean(diff(eruptions[-n_eruptions]))\navg_years_between_eruptions\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout .hidden}\n\n```\n[1] 79.83333\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBased on data up to and including 1971, eruptions on La Palma happen every 79.8 years on average.\n\nStudies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as @marrero2019, have proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir (10-20km depth).\n\nEight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s (@fig-timeline).\n\nData and methods are discussed in @sec-data-methods.\n\nLet $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution\n\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{x}}{x !}\n$$ {#eq-poisson}\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.\n\n| Name                 | Year   |\n| -------------------- | ------ |\n| Current              | 2021   |\n|

tone should be semi-professional.\nFocus on the underlying, core problem of the conflict between \"exponential expansion\" of exploring and explaining topics vs. writing a MA thesis which has a coherent \"trail of thought\" and the \"attention which follow the writing sequentially\".\n\nCrucial questions which each need to be addressed specifically:\n\nWhat about the underlying, core problem of the conflict between \"exponential expansion\" of exploring and explaining topics vs. writing a MA thesis which has a coherent \"trail of thought\" and the \"attention which follow the writing sequentially\"?\n\nWhat about the question of how to find/formulate the core research question?\n\nWhat about the central thesis?\n\nWhat are ways of deciding where/how to start the thesis?\n\nWhat workflows can help finding the best possible outline and what ideas to include / leave out?\n\nWhat are the most productive ways of conceptualizing the \"map of knowledge\" / \"web/network of understanding\" vs. the sequential form-factor required by a thesis?\n\nWhat are the most productive ways of conceptualizing the relationship between attention (e.g. while reading/following along) and understanding/knowledge (connecting concepts to previous knowledge, building up blocks of understanding from smaller chunks of information... optimal order of information etc.)?\n\nWhat are the best practices for explaining a web of knowledge in a (necessarily) sequential way?\n\nHow can LLMs be used most effectively, given these challenges/considerations (e.g. practical application in iteration loops etc.)?\n\nWhat software mitigations/solutions help addressing the core trade-offs (e.g. links, glossaries, footnotes, comments ...)?\n\nHow should can one think productively about the possibilities from \"new\" formats (e.g. interactive html / websites etc. over PDF)?\n\nWhat are the best practices for deciding what to include, given that a thesis comes with strict limitations on the length?\n\nHow to think about the trade-off between comprehensiveness and \"easy to follow / clear progression of arguments / conciseness?\n\nAfter discussing all these questions in detail, as well as the underlying points/vibe, discuss possible ways of accounting and working around/including all the above in the software workflow for writing a MA Thesis with the help of LLMs.\nI have numerous notes, drafts, todo lists, improvement ideas, versions of outlines, etc. please suggest the best possible setups/workflows to produce the best possible master's thesis (specifically iteration/prompting loops involving LLM's such as yourself).\n\n<!-- [ ]: ToDos -->\n% test\n<!-- Comments -->\n\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n:::{#refs}\n\n:::",
