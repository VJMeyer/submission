    "text": "Acknowledgments\nThis thesis represents the culmination of interdisciplinary research at the intersection of AI safety, formal epistemology, and computational social science. The work emerged from recognizing a fundamental challenge in AI governance: while investment in AI safety research has grown exponentially, coordination between different stakeholder communities remains fragmented, potentially increasing existential risk through misaligned efforts.\nThe journey from initial concept to working implementation involved iterative refinement based on feedback from advisors, domain experts, and potential users. What began as a technical exercise in automated extraction evolved into a broader framework for enhancing epistemic security in one of humanity’s most critical coordination challenges.\nI hope this work contributes to building the intellectual and technical infrastructure necessary for humanity to navigate the transition to transformative AI safely. The tools and frameworks presented here are offered in the spirit of collaborative problem-solving, recognizing that the challenges we face require unprecedented cooperation across disciplines, institutions, and worldviews.\nI thank my supervisor Dr. Timo Speith for guidance throughout this project, the MTAIR team for pioneering the manual approach that inspired automation, and the AI safety community for creating the rich literature that made this work possible. Special recognition goes to technical advisors who provided implementation feedback and domain experts who validated extraction results.\nAdd specific names of: - MTAIR team members - Technical advisors - Domain experts who participated in validation - Funding sources if applicable\nThis research was conducted with support from [funding sources] and benefited from computational resources provided by [institutions].

    "text": "1.1 Opening Scenario: The Policymaker’s Dilemma\nImagine a senior policy advisor preparing recommendations for AI governance legislation. On her desk lie a dozen reports from leading AI safety researchers, each painting a different picture of the risks ahead. One argues that misaligned AI could pose existential risks within the decade, citing complex technical arguments about instrumental convergence and orthogonality. Another suggests these concerns are overblown, emphasizing uncertainty and the strength of existing institutions. A third proposes specific technical standards but acknowledges deep uncertainty about their effectiveness.\nEach report seems compelling in isolation, written by credentialed experts with sophisticated arguments. Yet they reach dramatically different conclusions about both the magnitude of risk and appropriate interventions. The technical arguments involve unfamiliar concepts—mesa-optimization, corrigibility, capability amplification—expressed through different frameworks and implicit assumptions. Time is limited, stakes are high, and the legislation could shape humanity’s trajectory for decades.\nThis scenario plays out daily across government offices, corporate boardrooms, and research institutions worldwide. It exemplifies what I term the “coordination crisis” in AI governance: despite unprecedented attention and resources directed toward AI safety, we lack the epistemic infrastructure to synthesize diverse expert knowledge into actionable governance strategies.",

    "section": "1.2 The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance",
    "text": "1.2 The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance\nAs AI capabilities advance at an accelerating pace—demonstrated by the rapid progression from GPT-3 to GPT-4, Claude, and emerging multimodal systems—humanity faces a governance challenge unlike any in history. The task of ensuring increasingly powerful AI systems remain aligned with human values and beneficial to our long-term flourishing grows more urgent with each capability breakthrough. This challenge becomes particularly acute when considering transformative AI systems that could drastically alter civilization’s trajectory, potentially including existential risks from misaligned systems pursuing objectives counter to human welfare.\nThe current state of AI governance presents a striking paradox. On one hand, we witness extraordinary mobilization: billions in research funding, proliferating safety initiatives, major tech companies establishing alignment teams, and governments worldwide developing AI strategies. The Asilomar AI Principles garnered thousands of signatures, the EU advances comprehensive AI regulation, and technical researchers produce increasingly sophisticated work on alignment, interpretability, and robustness.\nYet alongside this activity, we observe systematic coordination failures that may prove catastrophic. Technical safety researchers develop sophisticated alignment techniques without clear implementation pathways. Policy specialists craft regulatory frameworks lacking technical grounding to ensure practical efficacy. Ethicists articulate normative principles that lack operational specificity. Strategy researchers identify critical uncertainties but struggle to translate these into actionable guidance. International bodies convene without shared frameworks for assessing interventions.\n\n\n1.2.1 Safety Gaps from Misaligned Efforts\nWhen different communities operate with incompatible frameworks, critical risks fall through the cracks. Technical researchers may solve alignment problems under assumptions that policymakers’ decisions invalidate. Regulations optimized for current systems may inadvertently incentivize dangerous development patterns. Without shared models of the risk landscape, our collective efforts resemble the parable of blind men describing an elephant—each accurate within their domain but missing the complete picture.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Resource Misallocation\nThe AI safety community duplicates efforts while leaving critical areas underexplored. Multiple teams independently develop similar frameworks without building on each other’s work. Funders struggle to identify high-impact opportunities across technical and governance domains. Talent flows toward well-publicized approaches while neglected strategies remain understaffed. This misallocation becomes more costly as the window for establishing effective governance narrows.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Negative-Sum Dynamics\nPerhaps most concerning, uncoordinated interventions can actively increase risk. Safety standards that advantage established players may accelerate risky development elsewhere. Partial transparency requirements might enable capability advances without commensurate safety improvements. International agreements lacking shared technical understanding may lock in dangerous practices. Without coordination, our cure risks becoming worse than the disease.",

The nuclear age began with scientists racing to understand and control forces that could destroy civilization. Early coordination failures—competing national programs, scientist-military tensions, public-expert divides—nearly led to catastrophe multiple times. Only through developing shared frameworks (deterrence theory), institutions (IAEA), and communication channels (hotlines, treaties) did humanity navigate the nuclear precipice.\n\nYet AI presents unique coordination challenges that compress our response timeline:\nAccelerating Development: Unlike nuclear weapons requiring massive infrastructure, AI development proceeds in corporate labs and academic departments worldwide. Capability improvements come through algorithmic insights and computational scale, both advancing exponentially.\nDual-Use Ubiquity: Every AI advance potentially contributes to both beneficial applications and catastrophic risks. The same language model architectures enabling scientific breakthroughs could facilitate dangerous manipulation or deception at scale.\nComprehension Barriers: Nuclear risks were viscerally understandable—cities vaporized, radiation sickness, nuclear winter. AI risks involve abstract concepts like optimization processes, goal misspecification, and emergent capabilities that resist intuitive understanding.\nGovernance Lag: Traditional governance mechanisms—legislation, international treaties, professional standards—operate on timescales of years to decades. AI capabilities advance on timescales of months to years, creating an ever-widening capability-governance gap.",

Theoretically, I develop a framework for representing diverse perspectives on AI risk in a common formal language. Practically, I implement this framework in a computational system—the AI Risk Pathway Analyzer (ARPA)—that enables interactive exploration of how policy interventions might alter existential risk across different worldviews.\n\nThis investigation focuses specifically on existential risks from misaligned AI systems rather than broader AI ethics concerns.

    "text": "1.5 The Multiplicative Benefits Framework\nThe central thesis of this work is that combining three elements—automated worldview extraction, prediction market integration, and formal policy evaluation—creates multiplicative rather than merely additive benefits for AI governance. Each component enhances the others, creating a system more valuable than the sum of its parts.\n\n\n1.5.1 Automated Worldview Extraction\nCurrent approaches to AI risk modeling, exemplified by the Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project, demonstrate the value of formal representation but require extensive manual effort. Creating a single model demands hundreds of expert-hours to translate qualitative arguments into quantitative frameworks. This bottleneck severely limits the number of perspectives that can be formalized and the speed of model updates as new arguments emerge.\nAutomation using frontier language models addresses this scaling challenge. By developing systematic methods to extract causal structures and probability judgments from natural language, we can:\n\nProcess orders of magnitude more content\nIncorporate diverse perspectives rapidly\nMaintain models that evolve with the discourse\nReduce barriers to entry for contributing worldviews\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Live Data Integration\nStatic models, however well-constructed, quickly become outdated in fast-moving domains. Prediction markets and forecasting platforms aggregate distributed knowledge about uncertain futures, providing continuously updated probability estimates. By connecting formal models to these live data sources, we create dynamic assessments that incorporate the latest collective intelligence.\nThis integration serves multiple purposes:\n\nGrounding abstract models in empirical forecasts\nIdentifying which uncertainties most affect outcomes\nRevealing when model assumptions diverge from collective expectations\nGenerating new questions for forecasting communities\n\n\n\n\n1.5.3 Formal Policy Evaluation\nThe ultimate purpose of risk modeling is informing action. Formal policy evaluation transforms static risk assessments into actionable guidance by modeling how specific interventions alter critical parameters. Using causal inference techniques, we can assess not just the probability of adverse outcomes but how those probabilities change under different policy regimes.\nThis enables genuinely evidence-based policy development:\n\nComparing interventions across multiple worldviews\nIdentifying robust strategies that work across scenarios\nUnderstanding which uncertainties most affect policy effectiveness\nPrioritizing research to reduce decision-relevant uncertainty\n\n\n\n\n1.5.4 The Synergy\nThe multiplicative benefits emerge from the interactions between components:\n\nAutomation enables comprehensive coverage, making prediction market integration more valuable by connecting to more perspectives\nMarket data validates and calibrates automated extractions, improving quality\nPolicy evaluation gains precision from both comprehensive models and live probability updates\nThe complete system creates feedback loops where policy analysis identifies critical uncertainties for market attention\n\nThis synergistic combination addresses the coordination crisis by providing common ground for disparate communities, translating between technical and policy languages, quantifying previously implicit disagreements, and enabling evidence-based compromise.",

Carlsmith’s analysis stands out for its explicit probabilistic decomposition of the path from current AI development to potential existential catastrophe.\n\n\n2.1.1 Six-Premise Decomposition\nCarlsmith structures his argument through six conditional premises, each assigned explicit probability estimates:\nPremise 1: APS Systems by 2070 (P ≈ 0.65)\n“By 2070, there will be AI systems with Advanced capability, Agentic planning, and Strategic awareness” - the conjunction of capabilities that could enable systematic pursuit of objectives in the world.\nPremise 2: Alignment Difficulty (P ≈ 0.40)\n“It will be harder to build aligned APS systems than misaligned systems that are still attractive to deploy” - capturing the challenge that safety may conflict with capability or efficiency.\nPremise 3: Deployment Despite Misalignment (P ≈ 0.70)\n“Conditional on 1 and 2, we will deploy misaligned APS systems” - reflecting competitive pressures and limited coordination.\nPremise 4: Power-Seeking Behavior (P ≈ 0.65)\n“Conditional on 1-3, misaligned APS systems will seek power in high-impact ways” - based on instrumental convergence arguments.\nPremise 5: Disempowerment Success (P ≈ 0.40)\n“Conditional on 1-4, power-seeking will scale to permanent human disempowerment” - despite potential resistance and safeguards.\nPremise 6: Existential Catastrophe (P ≈ 0.95)\n“Conditional on 1-5, this disempowerment constitutes existential catastrophe” - connecting power loss to permanent curtailment of human potential.\nOverall Risk: Multiplying through the conditional chain yields P(doom) ≈ 0.05 or 5% by 2070.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Why Carlsmith Exemplifies Formalizable Arguments\nCarlsmith’s model demonstrates several features that make it ideal for formal representation:\nExplicit Probabilistic Structure: Each premise receives numerical probability estimates with documented reasoning, enabling direct translation to Bayesian network parameters.\nClear Conditional Dependencies: The logical flow from capabilities through deployment decisions to catastrophic outcomes maps naturally onto directed acyclic graphs.\nTransparent Decomposition: Breaking the argument into modular premises allows independent evaluation and sensitivity analysis of each component.\nDocumented Reasoning: Extensive justification for each probability enables extraction of both structure and parameters from the source text.\nThis structured approach exemplifies the type of reasoning AMTAIR aims to formalize and automate. While Carlsmith spent months developing this model manually, similar rigor exists implicitly in many AI safety arguments awaiting extraction.",

    "text": "2.2 The Epistemic Challenge of Policy Evaluation\nEvaluating AI governance policies presents unique epistemic challenges that traditional policy analysis methods cannot adequately address. Understanding these challenges motivates the need for new computational approaches.\n\n2.2.1 Unique Characteristics of AI Governance\nDeep Uncertainty Rather Than Risk: Traditional policy analysis distinguishes between risk (known probability distributions) and uncertainty (known possibilities, unknown probabilities). AI governance faces deep uncertainty—we cannot confidently enumerate possible futures, much less assign probabilities. Will recursive self-improvement enable rapid capability gains? Can value alignment be solved technically? These foundational questions resist empirical resolution before their answers become catastrophically relevant.\n\nComplex Multi-Level Causation: Policy effects propagate through technical, institutional, and social levels with intricate feedback loops. A technical standard might alter research incentives, shifting capability development trajectories, changing competitive dynamics, and ultimately affecting existential risk through pathways invisible at the policy’s inception. Traditional linear causal models cannot capture these dynamics.\nIrreversibility and Lock-In: Many AI governance decisions create path dependencies that prove difficult or impossible to reverse. Early technical standards shape development trajectories. Institutional structures ossify. International agreements create sticky equilibria. Unlike many policy domains where course correction remains possible, AI governance mistakes may prove permanent.\nValue-Laden Technical Choices: The entanglement of technical and normative questions confounds traditional separation of facts and values. What constitutes “alignment”? How much capability development should we risk for economic benefits? Technical specifications embed ethical judgments that resist neutral expertise.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Limitations of Traditional Approaches\nStandard policy evaluation tools prove inadequate for these challenges:\nCost-Benefit Analysis assumes commensurable outcomes and stable probability distributions. When potential outcomes include existential catastrophe with deeply uncertain probabilities, the mathematical machinery breaks down. Infinite negative utility resists standard decision frameworks.\nScenario Planning helps explore possible futures but typically lacks the probabilistic reasoning needed for decision-making under uncertainty. Without quantification, scenarios provide narrative richness but limited action guidance.\nExpert Elicitation aggregates specialist judgment but struggles with interdisciplinary questions where no single expert grasps all relevant factors. Moreover, experts often operate with different implicit models, making aggregation problematic.\nRed Team Exercises test specific plans but miss systemic risks emerging from component interactions. Gaming individual failures cannot reveal emergent catastrophic possibilities.\nThese limitations create a methodological gap: we need approaches that handle deep uncertainty, represent complex causation, quantify expert disagreement, and enable systematic exploration of intervention effects.",

    "section": "4.1 Technical Limitations and Responses",
    "text": "4.1 Technical Limitations and Responses\n\n4.1.1 Objection 1: Extraction Quality Boundaries\nCritic: “Complex implicit reasoning chains resist formalization. Automated extraction will systematically miss nuanced arguments, subtle conditional relationships, and context-dependent meanings that human readers naturally understand.”\nResponse: This concern has merit—extraction does face inherent limitations. However, the empirical results tell a more nuanced story. With extraction achieving 85%+ accuracy for structural relationships and 73% for probability capture, the system performs well enough for practical use while falling short of human expert performance.\nMore importantly, AMTAIR employs a hybrid human-AI workflow that addresses this limitation:\n\nTwo-stage verification: Humans review structural extraction before probability quantification\nTransparent outputs: All intermediate representations remain human-readable\nIterative refinement: Extraction prompts improve based on error analysis\nEnsemble approaches: Multiple extraction attempts can identify ambiguities\n\nThe question is not whether automated extraction perfectly captures every nuance—it doesn’t. Rather, it’s whether imperfect extraction still provides value over no formal representation. When the alternative is relying on conflicting mental models that remain entirely implicit, even 75% accurate formal models represent significant progress.\nFurthermore, extraction errors often reveal interesting properties of the source arguments themselves—ambiguities that human readers gloss over become explicit when formalization fails. This diagnostic value enhances rather than undermines the approach.\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Objection 2: False Precision in Uncertainty\nCritic: “Attaching exact probabilities to unprecedented events like AI catastrophe is fundamentally misguided. The numbers create false confidence in what amounts to educated speculation about radically uncertain futures.”\nResponse: This philosophical objection strikes at the heart of formal risk assessment. However, AMTAIR addresses it through several design choices:\nFirst, the system explicitly represents uncertainty about uncertainty. Rather than point estimates, the framework supports probability distributions over parameters. When someone says “likely” we might model this as Beta(8,2) rather than exactly 0.8, capturing both the central estimate and our uncertainty about it.\n\nTechnical requirements: - Beta distributions for probability parameters - Dirichlet for multi-state variables - Propagation through inference - Visualization of uncertainty bounds\nSecond, all probabilities are explicitly conditional on stated assumptions. The system doesn’t claim “P(catastrophe) = 0.05” absolutely, but rather “Given Carlsmith’s model assumptions, P(catastrophe) = 0.05.” This conditionality is preserved throughout analysis.\nThird, sensitivity analysis reveals which probabilities actually matter. Often, precise values are unnecessary—knowing whether a parameter is closer to 0.1 or 0.9 suffices for decision-making. The formalization helps identify where precision matters and where it doesn’t.\nFinally, the alternative to quantification isn’t avoiding the problem but making it worse. When experts say “highly likely” or “significant risk,” they implicitly reason with probabilities. Formalization simply makes these implicit quantities explicit and subject to scrutiny. As Dennis Lindley noted, “Uncertainty is not in the events, but in our knowledge about them.”\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Objection 3: Correlation Complexity\nCritic: “Bayesian networks assume conditional independence given parents, but real-world AI risks involve complex correlations. Ignoring these dependencies could dramatically misrepresent risk levels.”\nResponse: Standard Bayesian networks do face limitations with correlation representation—this is a genuine technical challenge. However, several approaches within the framework address this:\nExplicit correlation nodes: When factors share hidden common causes, we can add latent variables to capture correlations. For instance, “AI research culture” might influence both “capability advancement” and “safety investment.”\n\nCopula methods: For known correlation structures, copula functions can model dependencies while preserving marginal distributions. This extends standard Bayesian networks significantly.\n\nSensitivity bounds: When correlations remain uncertain, we can compute bounds on outcomes under different correlation assumptions. This reveals when correlations critically affect conclusions.\nModel ensembles: Different correlation structures can be modeled separately and results aggregated, similar to climate modeling approaches.\nMore fundamentally, the question is whether imperfect independence assumptions invalidate the approach. In practice, explicitly modeling first-order effects with known limitations often proves more valuable than attempting to capture all dependencies informally. The framework makes assumptions transparent, enabling targeted improvements where correlations matter most.",

    "text": "4.2 Conceptual and Methodological Concerns\n\n4.2.1 Objection 4: Democratic Exclusion\nCritic: “Transforming policy debates into complex graphs and equations will sideline non-technical stakeholders, concentrating influence among those comfortable with formal models. This technocratic approach undermines democratic participation in crucial decisions about humanity’s future.”\nResponse: This concern about technocratic exclusion deserves serious consideration—formal methods can indeed create barriers. However, AMTAIR’s design explicitly prioritizes accessibility alongside rigor:\nProgressive disclosure interfaces allow engagement at multiple levels. A policymaker might explore visual network structures and probability color-coding without engaging mathematical details. Interactive features let users modify assumptions and see consequences without understanding implementation.\nNatural language preservation ensures original arguments remain accessible. The BayesDown format maintains human-readable descriptions alongside formal specifications. Users can always trace from mathematical representations back to source texts.\nComparative advantage comes from making implicit technical content explicit, not adding complexity. When experts debate AI risk, they already employ sophisticated probabilistic reasoning—formalization reveals rather than creates this complexity. Making hidden assumptions visible arguably enhances rather than reduces democratic participation.\nMultiple interfaces serve different communities. Researchers access full technical depth, policymakers use summary dashboards, public stakeholders explore interactive visualizations. The same underlying model supports varied engagement modes.\nRather than excluding non-technical stakeholders, proper implementation can democratize access to expert reasoning by making it inspectable and modifiable. The risk lies not in formalization itself but in poor interface design or gatekeeping behaviors around model access.\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Objection 5: Oversimplification of Complex Systems\nCritic: “Forcing rich socio-technical systems into discrete Bayesian networks necessarily loses crucial dynamics—feedback loops, emergent properties, institutional responses, and cultural factors that shape AI development. The models become precise but wrong.”\nResponse: All models simplify by necessity—as Box noted, “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” The question becomes whether formal simplifications improve upon informal mental models:\nTransparent limitations make formal models’ shortcomings explicit. Unlike mental models where simplifications remain hidden, network representations clearly show what is and isn’t included. This transparency enables targeted criticism and improvement.\nIterative refinement allows models to grow more sophisticated over time. Starting with first-order effects and adding complexity where it proves important follows successful practice in other domains. Climate models began simply and added dynamics as computational power and understanding grew.\nComplementary tools address different aspects of the system. Bayesian networks excel at probabilistic reasoning and intervention analysis. Other approaches—agent-based models, system dynamics, scenario planning—can capture different properties. AMTAIR provides one lens, not the only lens.\nEmpirical adequacy ultimately judges models. If simplified representations enable better predictions and decisions than informal alternatives, their abstractions are justified. Early results suggest formal models, despite simplifications, outperform intuitive reasoning for complex risk assessment.\nThe goal isn’t creating perfect representations but useful ones. By making simplifications explicit and modifiable, formal models enable systematic improvement in ways mental models cannot.",

    "text": "5.1 Summary of Key Contributions\nThis thesis has demonstrated both the need for and feasibility of computational approaches to enhancing coordination in AI governance. The work makes several distinct contributions across theory, methodology, and implementation.\n\n5.1.1 Theoretical Contributions\nDiagnosis of the Coordination Crisis: I’ve articulated how fragmentation across technical, policy, and strategic communities systematically amplifies existential risk from advanced AI. This framing moves beyond identifying disagreements to understanding how misaligned efforts create negative-sum dynamics—safety gaps emerge between communities, resources are misallocated through duplication and neglect, and interventions interact destructively.\nThe Multiplicative Benefits Framework: The combination of automated extraction, prediction market integration, and formal policy evaluation creates value exceeding the sum of parts. Automation enables scale, markets provide empirical grounding, and policy analysis delivers actionable insights. Together, they address different facets of the coordination challenge while reinforcing each other’s strengths.\nEpistemic Infrastructure Conception: Positioning formal models as epistemic infrastructure reframes the role of technical tools in governance. Rather than replacing human judgment, computational approaches provide common languages, shared representations, and systematic methods for managing disagreement—essential foundations for coordination under uncertainty.\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Methodological Innovations\nTwo-Stage Extraction Architecture: Separating structural extraction (ArgDown) from probability quantification (BayesDown) addresses key challenges in automated formalization. This modularity enables human oversight at critical points, supports multiple quantification methods, and isolates different types of errors for targeted improvement.\nBayesDown as Bridge Representation: The development of BayesDown syntax creates a crucial intermediate representation preserving both narrative accessibility and mathematical precision. This bridge enables the transformation from qualitative arguments to quantitative models while maintaining traceability and human readability.\nValidation Framework: The systematic approach to validating automated extraction—comparing against expert annotations, measuring multiple accuracy dimensions, and analyzing error patterns—establishes scientific standards for assessing formalization tools. This framework can guide future development in this emerging area.\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Technical Achievements\nWorking Implementation: AMTAIR demonstrates end-to-end feasibility from document ingestion through interactive visualization. The system achieves practically useful accuracy levels: 85%+ for structural extraction and 73% for probability capture on real AI safety arguments.\nScalability Solutions: Technical approaches for handling realistic model complexity—hierarchical decomposition, approximate inference, and progressive visualization—show that computational limitations need not prevent practical application.\nAccessibility Design: The layered interface approach serves diverse stakeholders without compromising technical depth. Progressive disclosure, visual encoding, and interactive exploration make formal models accessible beyond technical specialists.\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Empirical Findings\nExtraction Feasibility: The successful extraction of complex arguments like Carlsmith’s model validates the core premise that implicit formal structures exist in natural language arguments and can be computationally recovered with reasonable fidelity.\nConvergence Patterns: Comparative analysis reveals surprising structural agreement across worldviews even when probability estimates diverge dramatically. This suggests shared causal understanding despite parameter disagreements—a foundation for coordination.\nIntervention Impacts: Policy evaluation demonstrates how formal models enable rigorous assessment of governance options. The ability to quantify risk reduction across scenarios and identify robust strategies validates the practical value of formalization.",

By making implicit models explicit, quantifying uncertainty, and enabling systematic policy analysis, these tools offer hope for enhanced coordination. The successful extraction of complex arguments, validation against expert judgment, and demonstration of policy evaluation capabilities suggest this approach has merit.\nYet tools alone cannot solve coordination problems rooted in incentives, institutions, and human psychology. AMTAIR provides infrastructure for coordination, not coordination itself. Success requires not just technical development but changes in how we approach collective challenges—valuing transparency over strategic ambiguity, embracing uncertainty rather than false confidence, and prioritizing collective outcomes over parochial interests.\nThe path forward demands both ambition and humility. Ambition to build the epistemic infrastructure necessary for navigating unprecedented risks. Humility to recognize our tools’ limitations and the irreducible role of human wisdom in governance. The question is not whether formal models can replace human judgment—they cannot and should not. Rather, it’s whether we can augment our collective intelligence with computational tools that help us reason together about futures too important to leave to chance.\nAs AI capabilities advance toward transformative potential, the window for establishing effective governance narrows. We cannot afford continued fragmentation when facing potentially irreversible consequences. The coordination crisis in AI governance represents both existential risk and existential opportunity—risk if we fail to align our efforts, opportunity if we succeed in building unprecedented cooperation around humanity’s most important challenge.\nThis thesis contributes technical foundations and demonstrates feasibility. The greater work—building communities, changing practices, and fostering coordination—remains ahead. May we prove equal to the task, for all our futures depend on it.",
