## Extrapolate .ipynb improvements / ideal notebook implementation (for outline / thesis)

1. Notebook must keep working
– add labels for each code cell: #| label: my_code_cell_test
   – add alt text, caption etc. for code cells?
– investigate if splitting up and using .py functions works (and makes sense)
– prevent “code-line overflow”
– check ideas from 'Code_Improvement_Plan'
–  new extension section?
– save .html properly for thesis html integration AND as PDF image ?
