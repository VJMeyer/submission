## Extrapolate .ipynb improvements / ideal notebook implementation (for outline / thesis)

### 1. Notebook must keep working

<!-- [ ] add labels for each code cell: #| label: my_code_cell_test -->
 
<!-- [ ] Test if alt text, caption etc. need to be added to code cells as well -->
   
<!-- [ ] investigate if splitting up and using .py functions works (and makes sense) -->

<!-- [ ]  prevent “code-line overflow” -->

<!-- [ ] check ideas from 'Code_Improvement_Plan' -->

<!-- [ ] Does it make sense to introudce a new 'extensions' section? (does it improve clarity?) -->

<!-- [ ] How to make the "API call Section" less annoying? -->

<!-- [ ] save .html graph output properly (for thesis html integration AND as PDF image for latex) -->

<!-- [ ] Create section with overview of code-labels -->

<!-- [ ]  Update file links e.g. where data is fetched from-->





<!-- [ ] Review best practices from: “Automated Python-LaTeX Documentation Generation”:  https://github.com/pederw455/python-latex-repo/tree/main -->


<!-- [ ] Redo Carlsmith data extraction - done but can be redone/improved with Opus4 -->


<!-- [ ] Simply pay for (or use free Gemini) API and test API calls (?) ... only if time permits -->



<!-- [ ] Task_Syntax -->
