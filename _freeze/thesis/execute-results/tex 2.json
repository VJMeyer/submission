These divisions systematically increase existential risk by creating safety gaps, misallocating resources, and fostering inconsistent approaches to interdependent problems. This thesis introduces AMTAIR (Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling), a computational approach that addresses this coordination failure by automating the extraction of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature using frontier language models.\n\nThe AMTAIR system implements an end-to-end pipeline that transforms unstructured text into interactive Bayesian networks through a novel two-stage extraction process: first capturing argument structure in ArgDown format, then enhancing it with probability information in BayesDown. This approach bridges communication gaps between stakeholders by making implicit models explicit, enabling comparison across different worldviews, providing a common language for discussing probabilistic relationships, and supporting policy evaluation across diverse scenarios.\n\n## Figure Testing\n\n[![Caption/Title](images/cover.png){#fig-testgraphic fig-alt=\"Alt Text / Description.\" fig-align=\"left\" width=\"20%\" fig-scap=\"Short caption\"}](https://vjmeyer.com)\n\nTesting crossreferencing grapics @fig-testgraphic.\n\n<!-- [ ] Figure out Outline to Outline to Draft Workflow -->\n\n<!-- [ ]: Clean up the introduction -->\n\n<!-- [ ]: Test Quarto-Code-Links: https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/components.html#code-links -->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n# [ ]: Configure the Quarto Manuscript options: https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/components.html#including-notebooks\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Grading\n\n### Research (10%)\n\n-   demonstrates knowledge of the subject area as drawn from appropriate sources\n-   incorporates insights from in-class discussions\n-   draws on appropriate additional materials beyond those covered in class (primary as well as secondary sources)\n-   covers relevant material at appropriate level of detail\n\n## Structure (10%)\n\n-   outlines project clearly in the introduction\n\n-   discussion follows a logical order\n\n-   order of sections corresponds to outline\n\n-   uses appropriate topic and transition sentences\n\n-   employs proper signposting and cross-referencing throughout paper\n\n-   sections are appropriately numbered and headlined\n\n<!-- ::: callout-tip -->\n\n## Callout Test — Language & Style (10%)\n\n-   employs appropriate tone and academic language\n\n-   uses effective and sophisticated sentence variety, diction, and vocabulary\n\n-   employs correct English spelling and grammar\n\n-   is clearly written and uses appropriate sentence complexity\n\n-   communicates main points effectively / is easy to follow\n\n-   formats citations and references correctly and consistently (e.g. (AUTHOR, YEAR) citation style)\n\n-   names all primary and secondary sources\n\n-   includes a complete list of references with full bibliographic details\n\n<!-- ::: -->\n\nMore text\n\n{{< embed chapters/Introduction.qmd >}}\n\n{{< embed chapters/Context.qmd >}}\n\n{{< embed chapters/AMTAIR.qmd >}}\n\n{{< embed chapters/Discussion.qmd >}}\n\n{{< embed chapters/Conclusion.qmd >}}\n\n<!-- {{< include context/GradingRubric.md >}} -->\n\n## Bibliography/References {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n# Prefatory Apparatus: Illustrations and Terminology --- Quick References {.unnumbered}\n\n<!-- {{< embed chapters/Frontmatter.qmd >}}  -->\n\n## MANUAL List of Tables {.unnumbered}\n\nTable 1: Table name\n\nTable 2: Table name\n\nTable 3: Table name\n\n## MANUAL List of Graphics & Figures {.unnumbered}\n\n## MANUAL List of Abbreviations {.unnumbered}\n\nesp. especially\n\nf., ff. following\n\nincl. including\n\np., pp. page(s)\n\nMAD Mutually Assured Destruction\n\n## Glossary {.unnumbered}\n\nterm\n\n:   Definition of term\n\nAnother term\n\n:   Description of second term\n\nText\n\n<!-- # Affidavit {.unnumbered} -->\n\n{{< embed chapters/Appendices.qmd >}}\n\n# Notebooks {.unnumbered}",
