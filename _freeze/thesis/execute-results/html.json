These divisions systematically increase existential risk by creating safety gaps, misallocating resources, and fostering inconsistent approaches to interdependent problems. This thesis introduces AMTAIR (Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling), a computational approach that addresses this coordination failure by automating the extraction of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature using frontier language models.\n\nThe AMTAIR system implements an end-to-end pipeline that transforms unstructured text into interactive Bayesian networks through a novel two-stage extraction process: first capturing argument structure in ArgDown format, then enhancing it with probability information in BayesDown. This approach bridges communication gaps between stakeholders by making implicit models explicit, enabling comparison across different worldviews, providing a common language for discussing probabilistic relationships, and supporting policy evaluation across diverse scenarios.\n\n<!-- [ ] Figure out Outline to Outline to Draft Workflow -->\n\n<!-- [ ] Figure out Thesis \"styling\" (book vs manuscript) -->\n\n<!-- [ ] Setup reliable \"save as PDF\" -->\n\n<!-- [ ] Setup \"save as LaTeX\" -->\n\n<!-- [ ] Adapt LaTeX / PDF based on (journal) template -->\n\n<!-- [ ]: Clean up the introduction -->\n\n<!-- [ ]: Test Quarto-Code-Links: https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/components.html#code-links -->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n# [ ]: Configure the Quarto Manuscript options: https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/components.html#including-notebooks\n```\n:::\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- \n# Grading\n\n## Research (10%)\n• demonstrates knowledge of the subject area as drawn from appropriate sources\n• incorporates insights from in-class discussions\n• draws on appropriate additional materials beyond those covered in class (primary as well as secondary sources)\n• covers relevant material at appropriate level of detail\n\n## Structure (10%)\n• outlines project clearly in the introduction\n• discussion follows a logical order\n• order of sections corresponds to outline\n• uses appropriate topic and transition sentences\n• employs proper signposting and cross-referencing throughout paper\n• sections are appropriately numbered and headlined\n\n##Language and Style (10%)\n• employs appropriate tone and academic language\n• uses effective and sophisticated sentence variety, diction, and vocabulary\n• employs correct English spelling and grammar\n• is clearly written and uses appropriate sentence complexity\n• communicates main points effectively / is easy to follow\n• formats citations and references correctly and consistently (e.g. (AUTHOR, YEAR) citation style)\n• names all primary and secondary sources\n• includes a complete list of references with full bibliographic details\n\n -->\n```\n\n<!-- ::: callout-tip -->\n\n## Callout Test — Language & Style\n\n• employs appropriate tone and academic language • uses effective and sophisticated sentence variety, diction, and vocabulary • employs correct English spelling and grammar • is clearly written and uses appropriate sentence complexity • communicates main points effectively / is easy to follow • formats citations and references correctly and consistently (e.g. (AUTHOR, YEAR) citation style) • names all primary and secondary sources • includes a complete list of references with full bibliographic details <!-- ::: -->\n\nMore text\n\n{{< embed chapters/Introduction.qmd >}}\n\n{{< embed chapters/Context.qmd >}}\n\n{{< embed chapters/AMTAIR.qmd >}}\n\n{{< embed chapters/Discussion.qmd >}}\n\n{{< embed chapters/Conclusion.qmd >}}\n\n## Bibliography/References {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n# Prefatory Apparatus: Illustrations and Terminology --- Quick References {.unnumbered}\n\n## List of Tables {.unnumbered}\n\nTable 1: Table name\n\nTable 2: Table name\n\nTable 3: Table name\n\n## List of Graphics & Figures {.unnumbered}\n\n## List of Abbreviations {.unnumbered}\n\nesp. especially\n\nf., ff. following\n\nincl. including\n\np., pp. page(s)\n\nMAD Mutually Assured Destruction\n\n## Glossary {.unnumbered}\n\n<!-- {{< embed chapters/Frontmatter.qmd >}}  -->\n\nterm\n\n:   Definition of term\n\nAnother term\n\n:   Description of second term\n\nText\n\n\\thispagestyle{empty} % Removes page numbering for current page\n\n\\vspace*{0.5cm}\n\\noindent\\large{\\textbf{Affidavit}} \n\\vspace{1cm}\\noindent \\\\\n\\normalsize{I hereby attest that I have written my thesis} \n\\vspace*{0.5cm}\\noindent \\\\\n\\textit{\\glqq \\titel \\grqq}\n\\vspace*{0.5cm}\\noindent \\\\\nindependently and without the use of other than the stated aids.
