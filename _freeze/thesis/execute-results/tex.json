These divisions systematically increase existential risk by creating\n  safety gaps, misallocating resources, and fostering inconsistent approaches to interdependent\n  problems. This thesis introduces AMTAIR (Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling), a\n  computational approach that addresses this coordination failure by automating the extraction of\n  probabilistic world models from AI safety literature using frontier language models.\n  \n  The AMTAIR system implements an end-to-end pipeline that transforms unstructured text into\n  interactive Bayesian networks through a novel two-stage extraction process: first capturing\n  argument structure in ArgDown format, then enhancing it with probability information in\n  BayesDown. This approach bridges communication gaps between stakeholders by making implicit\n  models explicit, enabling comparison across different worldviews, providing a common language\n  for discussing probabilistic relationships, and supporting policy evaluation across diverse scenarios.\nplain-language-summary: |\n  This thesis addresses coordination problems in AI safety by creating tools that automatically\n  extract and formalize the assumptions and models underlying different approaches to AI governance.\n  By transforming complex arguments into interactive visualizations showing relationships and\n  probabilities, AMTAIR helps bridge communication gaps between technical researchers, policy\n  specialists, and other stakeholders working to address risks from advanced AI.\nkey-points:\n  - A novel extraction pipeline transforms argument structures into Bayesian networks through a two-stage process\n  - Interactive visualizations make complex probabilistic relationships accessible to diverse stakeholders\n  - Formal representation enables comparison across different worldviews and assumptions\n  - The approach addresses coordination failures by creating a common language for AI risk assessment\nmetadata-submission:\n  field-of-study: \"Philosophy & Economics M.A.\"\n  matriculation-number: 1828610\n  submission-date: \"May 26, 2025\"\n  word-count: 30000\ndate: \"2025-05-26\"\nbibliography: ref/MAref.bib\ncitation:\n  container-title: University of Bayreuth\nnumber-sections: true\n---\n\n<!-- [ ] Figure out Outline to Outline to Draft Workflow -->\n\n<!-- [ ] Figure out Thesis \"styling\" (book vs manuscript) -->\n<!-- [ ] Setup reliable \"save as PDF\" -->\n<!-- [ ] Setup \"save as LaTeX\" -->\n<!-- [ ] Adapt LaTeX / PDF based on (journal) template -->\n\n\n\n<!-- [ ]: Clean up the introduction -->\n\n\n<!-- [ ]: Test Quarto-Code-Links: https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/components.html#code-links -->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# [ ]: Configure the Quarto Manuscript options: https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/components.html#including-notebooks\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n<!-- \n# Grading\n\n## Research (10%)\n• demonstrates knowledge of the subject area as drawn from appropriate sources\n• incorporates insights from in-class discussions\n• draws on appropriate additional materials beyond those covered in class (primary as well as secondary sources)\n• covers relevant material at appropriate level of detail\n\n## Structure (10%)\n• outlines project clearly in the introduction\n• discussion follows a logical order\n• order of sections corresponds to outline\n• uses appropriate topic and transition sentences\n• employs proper signposting and cross-referencing throughout paper\n• sections are appropriately numbered and headlined\n\n##Language and Style (10%)\n• employs appropriate tone and academic language\n• uses effective and sophisticated sentence variety, diction, and vocabulary\n• employs correct English spelling and grammar\n• is clearly written and uses appropriate sentence complexity\n• communicates main points effectively / is easy to follow\n• formats citations and references correctly and consistently (e.g. (AUTHOR, YEAR) citation style)\n• names all primary and secondary sources\n• includes a complete list of references with full bibliographic details\n\n -->\n\n{{< embed chapters/Frontmatter.qmd >}} \n\n\n\n\n{{< embed chapters/Introduction.qmd >}}\n\n{{< embed chapters/Context.qmd >}}\n\n{{< embed chapters/AMTAIR.qmd >}}\n\n{{< embed chapters/Discussion.qmd >}}\n\n{{< embed chapters/Conclusion.qmd >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n## Bibliography/References {.unnumbered}\n\n:::{#refs}\n\n:::\n\n{{< embed chapters/Appendices.qmd >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Notebooks\n\n\n\n\n\n# Quarto Example\n\n## Introduction\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\neruptions <- c(1492, 1585, 1646, 1677, 1712, 1949, 1971, 2021)\nn_eruptions <- length(eruptions)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npar(mar = c(3, 1, 1, 1) + 0.1)\nplot(eruptions, rep(0, n_eruptions), \n  pch = \"|\", axes = FALSE)\naxis(1)\nbox()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Timeline of recent earthquakes on La Palma](thesis_files/figure-pdf/fig-timeline-1.pdf){#fig-timeline fig-pos='H' fig-alt='An event plot of the years of the last 8 eruptions on La Palma.'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\navg_years_between_eruptions <- mean(diff(eruptions[-n_eruptions]))\navg_years_between_eruptions\n```\n:::\n\n\nBased on data up to and including 1971, eruptions on La Palma happen every 79.8 years on average.\n\nStudies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as @marrero2019, have proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir (10-20km depth).\n\nEight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s (@fig-timeline).\n\nData and methods are discussed in @sec-data-methods.\n\nLet $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution\n\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{x}}{x !}\n$$ {#eq-poisson}\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.\n\n| Name                 | Year   |\n| -------------------- | ------ |\n| Current              | 2021   |\n| Teneguía             | 1971   |\n| Nambroque            | 1949   |\n| El Charco            | 1712   |\n| Volcán San Antonio   | 1677   |\n| Volcán San Martin    | 1646   |\n| Tajuya near El Paso  | 1585   |\n| Montaña Quemada      | 1492   |\n\n: Recent historic eruptions on La Palma {#tbl-history}\n\n@tbl-history summarises the eruptions recorded since the colonization of the islands by Europeans in the late 1400s.\n\n![Map of La Palma](images/la-palma-map.png){#fig-map}\n\nLa Palma is one of the west most islands in the Volcanic Archipelago of the Canary Islands (@fig-map). \n\n{{< embed notebooks/explore-earthquakes.qmd#fig-spatial-plot >}}\n\n@fig-spatial-plot shows the location of recent Earthquakes on La Palma.\n\n## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n\n## Conclusion\n\n{{< embed chapters/section1.qmd >}}\n",
