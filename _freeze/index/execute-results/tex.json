These divisions systematically increase existential risk by creating safety gaps, misallocating resources, and fostering inconsistent approaches to interdependent problems.`\n\n> This thesis introduces AMTAIR (Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling), a computational approach that addresses this coordination failure by automating the extraction of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature using frontier language models.\n\n`The AMTAIR system implements an end-to-end pipeline that transforms unstructured text into interactive Bayesian networks through a novel two-stage extraction process: first capturing argument structure in ArgDown format, then enhancing it with probability information in BayesDown. This approach bridges communication gaps between stakeholders by making implicit models explicit, enabling comparison across different worldviews, providing a common language for discussing probabilistic relationships, and supporting policy evaluation across diverse scenarios.`\n\n<!-- [ ] Add key quantitative results and validation findings to Abstract-->\n\n# Prefatory Apparatus: Frontmatter {.unnumbered}\n\n## Illustrations and Terminology --- Quick References {.unnumbered}\n\n### **Acknowledgments**\n\n-   Academic supervisor (Prof. Timo Speith) and institution (University of Bayreuth)\\\n-   Research collaborators, especially those connected to the original MTAIR project\\\n-   Technical advisors who provided feedback on implementation aspects\\\n-   Personal supporters who enabled the research through encouragement and feedback\n\n<!-- [ ] Ensure List of Tables is up-to-date -->\n\n## List of Graphics & Figures {.unnumbered}\n\n<!-- [ ] Replace Placeholder List of Graphics & Figures with native Quarto LoF -->\n\n<!-- [ ] Populate List of Graphics & Figures with ALL figures from thesis -->\n\n-   Figure 1.1: The coordination crisis in AI governance - visualization of fragmentation\\\n-   Figure 2.1: The Carlsmith model - DAG representation\\\n-   Figure 3.1: Research design overview - workflow diagram\\\n-   Figure 3.2: From natural language to BayesDown - transformation process\\\n-   Figure 4.1: ARPA system architecture - component diagram\\\n-   Figure 4.2: Visualization of Rain-Sprinkler-Grass_Wet Bayesian network - screenshot\\\n-   Figure 5.1: Extraction quality metrics - comparative chart\\\n-   Figure 5.2: Comparative analysis of AI governance worldviews - network visualization\n\n## List of Abbreviations {.unnumbered}\n\n<!-- [ ] Replace Placeholder List of Abbreviations with native Quarto Glossary -->\n\n<!-- [ ] Populate List of Abbreviations with ALL terms from thesis -->\n\nesp. especially\n\nf., ff. following\n\nincl. including\n\np., pp. page(s)\n\nMAD Mutually Assured Destruction\n\n-   AI - Artificial Intelligence\\\n-   AGI - Artificial General Intelligence\\\n-   ARPA - AI Risk Pathway Analyzer\\\n-   DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph\\\n-   LLM - Large Language Model\\\n-   MTAIR - Modeling Transformative AI Risks\\\n-   P(Doom) - Probability of existential catastrophe from misaligned AI\\\n-   CPT - Conditional Probability Table\n\n## Glossary {.unnumbered .unlisted}\n\n<!-- [ ] Replace Placeholder Glossary with native Quarto Glossary -->\n\n<!-- [ ] Populate Glossary with ALL terms from thesis -->\n\n-   **Argument mapping**: A method for visually representing the structure of arguments\\\n-   **BayesDown**: An extension of ArgDown that incorporates probabilistic information\\\n-   **Bayesian network**: A probabilistic graphical model representing variables and their dependencies\\\n-   **Conditional probability**: The probability of an event given that another event has occurred\\\n-   **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: A graph with directed edges and no cycles\\\n-   **Existential risk**: Risk of permanent curtailment of humanity's potential\\\n-   **Power-seeking AI**: AI systems with instrumental incentives to acquire resources and power\\\n-   **Prediction market**: A market where participants trade contracts that resolve based on future events\\\n-   **d-separation**: A criterion for identifying conditional independence relationships in Bayesian networks\\\n-   **Monte Carlo sampling**: A computational technique using random sampling to obtain numerical results\n\n<!-- {{< include chapters/Outlining-Workflow.md >}} -->\n\n<!-- \\listoffigures -->\n\n### Quarto Features Previously Incompatible with LaTeX (Below) {.unnumbered .unlisted}\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- \n::: {.hidden}\n$$\n \\def\\RR{{\\bf R}}\n \\def\\bold#1{{\\bf #1}}\n$$\n::: -->\n```\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- :::note\nRemember to connect this back to the research question\n::: -->\n```\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- ::: {.callout-note}\n## Optional Title\nContent here\n::: -->\n```\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- (@)  A list whose numbering\n\ncontinues after\n\n(@)  an interruption -->\n```\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- ::: {}\n1.
