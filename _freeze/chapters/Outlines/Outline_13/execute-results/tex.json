The AMTAIR (Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling) system implements an end-to-end pipeline transforming unstructured arguments into interactive Bayesian networks through a novel two-stage extraction process: first capturing argument structure in ArgDown format, then enhancing it with probability information in BayesDown.\n\nApplied to canonical examples and real AI safety arguments, the system demonstrates extraction accuracy exceeding 85% for structural relationships and 73% for probability capture. By making implicit models explicit, enabling cross-worldview comparison, and supporting rigorous policy evaluation, AMTAIR bridges communication gaps between technical researchers, policy specialists, and other stakeholders working to address existential risks from advanced AI.\n\nThe thesis contributes both theoretical foundations and practical implementation, validated through expert comparison and real-world case studies including Carlsmith's power-seeking AI model. While current limitations include correlation handling and extraction ambiguities, the approach provides essential epistemic infrastructure for coordinated AI governance. plain-language-summary: | This thesis develops software tools that automatically extract and visualize the hidden assumptions and probability estimates in AI safety arguments. By transforming complex written arguments into interactive diagrams showing relationships and probabilities, AMTAIR helps different groups working on AI safety—researchers, policymakers, and others—understand each other better and coordinate their efforts to address risks from advanced AI systems. key-points:\n\n- A novel two-stage extraction pipeline transforms argument structures into Bayesian networks through ArgDown and BayesDown intermediate representations\n- Interactive visualizations make complex probabilistic relationships accessible to diverse stakeholders\n- Formal representation enables systematic comparison across different worldviews and assumptions\n- Validated extraction achieves >85% accuracy for structure and >73% for probabilities\n- The approach addresses coordination failures by creating a common language for AI risk assessment date: \"2025-05-26\" bibliography: ref/MAref.bib citation: container-title: University of Bayreuth Master's Thesis number-sections: true toc: true toc-depth: 4 lof: true lot: true\n```\n\n\n---\n\n# Frontmatter: Preface {.unnumbered}\n\n<!-- [ ] TODO: Expand preface to include personal journey and acknowledgments -->\n\nThis thesis represents the culmination of interdisciplinary research at the intersection of AI safety, formal epistemology, and computational social science.

Introduction: The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance {#sec-introduction}\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Chapter Overview\n\n**Grade Weight**: 10% | **Target Length**: ~14% of text (~4,200 words)  \n**Requirements**: Introduces and motivates the core question, provides context, states precise thesis, provides roadmap\n:::\n\n## 1.1 Opening Scenario: The Policymaker's Dilemma {#sec-opening-scenario}\n\n<!-- [ ] TODO: Polish opening scenario for maximum impact -->\n\n<!-- [ ] ADD: @todd2024 add as reference for more resources towards AI safety --> \n@todd2024\n\nImagine a senior policy advisor preparing recommendations for AI governance legislation. On her desk lie a dozen reports from leading AI safety researchers, each painting a different picture of the risks ahead. One argues that misaligned AI could pose existential risks within the decade, citing complex technical arguments about instrumental convergence and orthogonality. Another suggests these concerns are overblown, emphasizing uncertainty and the strength of existing institutions. A third proposes specific technical standards but acknowledges deep uncertainty about their effectiveness.\n\n::: {.redundant-content data-better-version=\"Outline_12.2#sec-opening\"}\nEach report seems compelling in isolation, written by credentialed experts with sophisticated arguments. Yet they reach dramatically different conclusions about both the magnitude of risk and appropriate interventions. The technical arguments involve unfamiliar concepts—mesa-optimization, corrigibility, capability amplification—expressed through different frameworks and implicit assumptions. Time is limited, stakes are high, and the legislation could shape humanity's trajectory for decades.\n:::\n\nThis scenario plays out daily across government offices, corporate boardrooms, and research institutions worldwide. It exemplifies what I term the \"coordination crisis\" in AI governance: despite unprecedented attention and resources directed toward AI safety, we lack the epistemic infrastructure to synthesize diverse expert knowledge into actionable governance strategies.\n\n<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-policymaker-dilemma}: \"Visual representation of conflicting expert reports on advisor's desk\" -->\n\n## 1.2 The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance {#sec-coordination-crisis}\n\n<!-- [ ] TODO: Frame the problem as coordination failure rather than merely technical challenge -->\n\n<!-- [ ] ADD: @maslej2025  Add citation for page 85 as evidence for accelerating capabilities -->\n\n@maslej2025\n\n<!-- [ ] ADD: @samborska2025  Add as citation for accelerating capabilities -->\n\n@samborska2025\n\nAs AI capabilities advance at an accelerating pace—demonstrated by the rapid progression from GPT-3 to GPT-4, Claude, and emerging multimodal systems—humanity faces a governance challenge unlike any in history. The task of ensuring increasingly powerful AI systems remain aligned with human values and beneficial to our long-term flourishing grows more urgent with each capability breakthrough. This challenge becomes particularly acute when considering transformative AI systems that could drastically alter civilization's trajectory, potentially including existential risks from misaligned systems pursuing objectives counter to human welfare.\n\n> Despite unprecedented investment in AI safety research, rapidly growing awareness among key stakeholders, and proliferating frameworks for responsible AI development, we face what I'll term the \"coordination crisis\" in AI governance—a systemic failure to align diverse efforts across technical, policy, and strategic domains into a coherent response proportionate to the risks we face.\n\nThe current state of AI governance presents a striking paradox. On one hand, we witness extraordinary mobilization: billions in research funding, proliferating safety initiatives, major tech companies establishing alignment teams, and governments worldwide developing AI strategies. The [Asilomar AI Principles](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/ai-principles/) garnered thousands of signatures, the EU advances [comprehensive AI regulation](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/the-act/) , and technical researchers produce increasingly sophisticated work on alignment, interpretability, and robustness.\n\n\n<!-- [ ] ADD: @tegmark2024  add citation for the Asilomar Principles Open Letter (as footnote?) -->\n@tegmark2024\n\n<!-- [ ] ADD: @european2024    add citation for the EU AI (as footnote) -->\n@european2024\n\n::: {.duplicate-content data-source=\"Outline_11.7#sec-coordination-crisis\"}\nYet alongside this activity, we observe systematic coordination failures that may prove catastrophic. Technical safety researchers develop sophisticated alignment techniques without clear implementation pathways. Policy specialists craft regulatory frameworks lacking technical grounding to ensure practical efficacy. Ethicists articulate normative principles that lack operational specificity. Strategy researchers identify critical uncertainties but struggle to translate these into actionable guidance. International bodies convene without shared frameworks for assessing interventions.\n:::\n\n<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-coordination-crisis}: \"Systems diagram showing fragmentation between AI governance communities\" -->\n\n### 1.2.1 Safety Gaps from Misaligned Efforts {#sec-safety-gaps}\n\n<!-- [ ] TODO: Document how fragmentation systematically increases risk through with specific, good examples -->\n\nThe fragmentation problem manifests in incompatible frameworks between technical researchers, policy specialists, and strategic analysts. Each community develops sophisticated approaches within their domain, yet translation between domains remains primitive. This creates systematic blind spots where risks emerge at the interfaces between technical capabilities, institutional responses, and strategic dynamics.\n\nWhen different communities operate with incompatible frameworks, critical risks fall through the cracks. Technical researchers may solve alignment problems under assumptions that policymakers' decisions invalidate. Regulations optimized for current systems may inadvertently incentivize dangerous development patterns. Without shared models of the risk landscape, our collective efforts resemble the parable of blind men describing an elephant—each accurate within their domain but missing the complete picture.\n\n\n\n<!-- [ ] FIND: @coordination-failure-examples: \"Specific historical examples of coordination failures in technology governance\" -- arms races to nobodies benefit -- technological race to ?? -->\n\n\n\n<!-- [ ] ADD: @paul2023 from Url: https://www.prismaguard.com/the-elephaint-are-we-all-like-the-six-blind-men-when-it-comes-to-ai/ for blind men elephant vs ai risk analogy--> \n\n@paul2023\n\n### 1.2.2 Resource Misallocation {#sec-resource-misallocation}\n\n<!-- [ ] TODO: Explain that duplicative efforts absorbing research funding, publications, and initiatives might sometimes improve reliability (think reproducing results) but tend to waste resources in expectation (opportuntity cost) -- change the tone of the paragraph accordingly  -->\n\nThe AI safety community duplicates efforts while leaving critical areas underexplored. Multiple teams independently develop similar frameworks without building on each other's work. Funders struggle to identify high-impact opportunities across technical and governance domains. Talent flows toward well-publicized approaches while neglected strategies remain understaffed. This misallocation becomes more costly as the window for establishing effective governance narrows.\n\n<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#tbl-resource-duplication}: \"Examples of duplicated AI safety efforts across organizations\" -->\n\n### 1.2.3 Negative-Sum Dynamics {#sec-negative-sum}\n\n<!-- [ ] TODO: Address capability-governance gaps widening with accelerating development -->\n\nPerhaps most concerning, uncoordinated interventions can actively increase risk. Safety standards that advantage established players may accelerate risky development elsewhere. Partial transparency requirements might enable capability advances without commensurate safety improvements. International agreements lacking shared technical understanding may lock in dangerous practices. Without coordination, our cure risks becoming worse than the disease.\n\n::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with=\"Outline_11.7#systematic-risk\"}\nCoordination failures systematically amplify existential risk through multiple pathways. Safety gaps emerge when technical solutions lack policy implementation pathways. Resource misallocation occurs when multiple teams unknowingly duplicate efforts while critical areas remain unaddressed. Most perniciously, locally optimized decisions by individual actors can create negative-sum dynamics that increase overall risk—an AI governance tragedy of the commons.\n:::\n\n<!-- [ ] ADD: @armstrong2016: \"Racing to the precipice: a model of artificial intelligence development\"\n    Add detailed explanation: \"Game-theoretic analysis of how uncoordinated AI policies can backfire\"  \n\n\n-->\n\n@armstrong2016\n\n<!-- [ ] ADD: @samuel2023, @hunt2025, @trager2025, \n    Cite all and explain in detail: -- prisoners dilemma vs. stag hunt -- anbody builds it everyone dies\n-->\n\n\n\n@samuel2023, @hunt2025\n\n\n\n<!-- [ ] LATER ADD: Citation for unpublished \"anbody builds it everyone dies (soares & yudkowsky)\" -->\n\n## 1.3 Historical Parallels and Temporal Urgency {#sec-historical-urgency}\n\n<!-- [ ] TODO: Draw connections to nuclear governance, climate change, and biosecurity -->\n\nHistory offers instructive parallels. The nuclear age began with scientists racing to understand and control forces that could destroy civilization. Early coordination failures—competing national programs, scientist-military tensions, public-expert divides—nearly led to catastrophe multiple times. Only through developing shared frameworks (deterrence theory), institutions (IAEA), and communication channels (hotlines, treaties) did humanity navigate the nuclear precipice.\n\n<!-- [ ] ADD: @schelling1960: \"Schelling, T.

Capability improvements come through algorithmic insights and computational scale, both advancing exponentially.\n\n**Dual-Use Ubiquity**: Every AI advance potentially contributes to both beneficial applications and catastrophic risks. The same language model architectures enabling scientific breakthroughs could facilitate dangerous manipulation or deception at scale.\n\n**Comprehension Barriers**: Nuclear risks were viscerally understandable—cities vaporized, radiation sickness, nuclear winter. AI risks involve abstract concepts like optimization processes, goal misspecification, and emergent capabilities that resist intuitive understanding.\n\n**Governance Lag**: Traditional governance mechanisms—legislation, international treaties, professional standards—operate on timescales of years to decades. AI capabilities advance on timescales of months to years, creating an ever-widening capability-governance gap.\n:::\n\n<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-governance-lag}: \"Timeline comparison of AI capability vs governance development\" -->\n\n## 1.4 Research Question and Scope {#sec-research-question}\n\n<!-- [ ] TODO: Clearly articulate the primary research question with precision -->\n\nThis thesis addresses a specific dimension of the coordination challenge by investigating the question:\n\n**Can frontier AI technologies be utilized to automate the modeling of transformative AI risks, enabling robust prediction of policy impacts across diverse worldviews?**\n\n::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with=\"Outline_11.7#research-question\"} \nMore specifically, I explore whether frontier language models can automate the extraction and formalization of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature, creating a scalable computational framework that enhances coordination in AI governance through systematic policy evaluation under uncertainty. \n:::\n\nTo break this down into its components:\n\n- **Frontier AI Technologies**: Today's most capable language models (GPT-4, Claude-3 level systems)\n- **Automated Modeling**: Using these systems to extract and formalize argument structures from natural language\n- **Transformative AI Risks**: Potentially catastrophic outcomes from advanced AI systems, particularly existential risks\n- **Policy Impact Prediction**: Evaluating how governance interventions might alter probability distributions over outcomes\n- **Diverse Worldviews**: Accounting for fundamental disagreements about AI development trajectories and risk factors\n\nThe investigation encompasses both theoretical development and practical implementation, focusing specifically on existential risks from misaligned AI systems rather than broader AI ethics concerns. This narrowed scope enables deep technical development while addressing the highest-stakes coordination challenges.\n\n<!-- [ ] LATER TODO: Refine thesis statement based on advisor feedback -->\n\n## 1.5 The Multiplicative Benefits Framework {#sec-multiplicative-benefits}\n\n<!-- [ ] TODO: Establish central thesis about synergistic combination of three elements -->\n\nThe central thesis of this work is that combining three elements—automated worldview extraction, prediction market integration, and formal policy evaluation—creates multiplicative rather than merely additive benefits for AI governance. Each component enhances the others, creating a system more valuable than the sum of its parts.\n\n<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-multiplicative-benefits}: \"Venn diagram showing synergies between extraction, markets, and evaluation\": \tAutomation × Live Prediction Market Integrations × Policy Impact Evaluations\n\n    - re-reference in Conclusion\n -->\n\n### 1.5.1 Automated Worldview Extraction {#sec-automated-extraction}\n\n::: {.duplicate-content data-source=\"Outline_11.7#automated-extraction\"} \n**Automated worldview extraction** using frontier language models addresses the scaling bottleneck in current approaches to AI risk modeling. The Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project demonstrated the value of formal representation but required extensive manual effort to translate qualitative arguments into quantitative models. Automation enables processing orders of magnitude more content, incorporating diverse perspectives, and maintaining models in near real-time as new arguments emerge. \n:::\n\nCurrent approaches to AI risk modeling, exemplified by the Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project, demonstrate the value of formal representation but require extensive manual effort. Creating a single model demands dozens of expert-hours to translate qualitative arguments into quantitative frameworks. This bottleneck severely limits the number of perspectives that can be formalized and the speed of model updates as new arguments emerge.\n\n<!-- [-] VERIFIED FALSE: @mtair-effort: \"Bucknall et al. (2022) - specific hour estimates for manual modeling\" NO SUCH SOURCE EXIST. REMOVE ANY MENTIONS! -->\n\nAutomation using frontier language models addresses this scaling challenge. By developing systematic methods to extract causal structures and probability judgments from natural language, we can:\n\n- Process orders of magnitude more content\n- Incorporate diverse perspectives rapidly\n- Maintain models that evolve with the discourse\n- Reduce barriers to entry for contributing worldviews\n\n### 1.5.2 Live Data Integration {#sec-live-data}\n\n::: {.redundant-content data-better-version=\"Outline_12.2#prediction-markets\"} \n**Prediction market integration** grounds these models in collective forecasting intelligence. By connecting formal representations to live forecasting platforms, the system can incorporate timely judgments about critical uncertainties from calibrated forecasters. This creates a dynamic feedback loop where models inform forecasters and forecasts update models. \n:::\n\nStatic models, however well-constructed, quickly become outdated in fast-moving domains. Prediction markets and forecasting platforms aggregate distributed knowledge about uncertain futures, providing continuously updated probability estimates. By connecting formal models to these live data sources, we create dynamic assessments that incorporate the latest collective intelligence.\n\nThis integration serves multiple purposes:\n\n- Grounding abstract models in empirical forecasts\n- Identifying which uncertainties most affect outcomes\n- Revealing when model assumptions diverge from collective expectations\n- Generating new questions for forecasting communities\n\n<!-- [ ] ADD: @tetlock2015 and introduce prediction markets for a general audience, explain how they can be used in forecasting technological developments and impacts -->\n@tetlock2015\n\n### 1.5.3 Formal Policy Evaluation {#sec-policy-evaluation}\n\n**Formal policy evaluation** transforms static risk assessments into actionable guidance by modeling how specific interventions alter critical parameters. Using causal inference techniques, we can assess not just the probability of adverse outcomes but how those probabilities change under different policy regimes.\n\nThis enables genuinely evidence-based policy development:\n\n- Comparing interventions across multiple worldviews\n- Identifying robust strategies that work across scenarios\n- Understanding which uncertainties most affect policy effectiveness\n- Prioritizing research to reduce decision-relevant uncertainty\n\n<!-- [ ] ADD: @pearl2000 and @pearl2009: \"Pearl, J.

The complete system creates feedback loops where policy analysis identifies critical uncertainties for market attention. \n:::\n\nThe multiplicative benefits emerge from the interactions between components:\n\n- Automation enables comprehensive coverage, making prediction market integration more valuable by connecting to more perspectives\n- Market data validates and calibrates automated extractions, improving quality\n- Policy evaluation gains precision from both comprehensive models and live probability updates\n- The complete system creates feedback loops where policy analysis identifies critical uncertainties for market attention\n\nThis synergistic combination addresses the coordination crisis by providing common ground for disparate communities, translating between technical and policy languages, quantifying previously implicit disagreements, and enabling evidence-based compromise.\n\n## 1.6 Thesis Structure and Roadmap {#sec-roadmap}\n\n<!-- [ ] TODO: Preview the logical progression of the thesis -->\n\nThe remainder of this thesis develops the multiplicative benefits framework from theoretical foundations to practical implementation:\n\n::: {.duplicate-content data-source=\"Outline_11.7#roadmap\"} \n**Chapter 2: Context and Theoretical Foundations** establishes the intellectual groundwork, examining the epistemic challenges unique to AI governance, Bayesian networks as formal tools for uncertainty representation, argument mapping as a bridge from natural language to formal models, the MTAIR project's achievements and limitations, and requirements for effective coordination infrastructure.\n\n**Chapter 3: AMTAIR Design and Implementation** presents the technical system including overall architecture and design principles, the two-stage extraction pipeline (ArgDown → BayesDown), validation methodology and results, case studies from simple examples to complex AI risk models, and integration with prediction markets and policy evaluation.\n\n**Chapter 4: Discussion - Implications and Limitations** critically examines technical limitations and failure modes, conceptual concerns about formalization, integration with existing governance frameworks, scaling challenges and opportunities, and broader implications for epistemic security.\n\n**Chapter 5: Conclusion** synthesizes key contributions and charts paths forward with a summary of theoretical and practical achievements, concrete recommendations for stakeholders, research agenda for community development, and vision for AI governance with proper coordination infrastructure. \n:::\n\nThroughout this progression, I maintain dual focus on theoretical sophistication and practical utility.

Understanding these challenges motivates the need for new computational approaches.\n\n\n\n### 2.2.1 Unique Characteristics of AI Governance {#sec-ai-governance-unique}\n\n::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with=\"Outline_11.7#epistemic-challenge\"} \nAI governance policy evaluation faces unique epistemic challenges that render traditional policy analysis methods insufficient. The domain combines complex causal chains with limited empirical grounding, deep uncertainty about future capabilities, divergent stakeholder worldviews, and few opportunities for experimental testing before deployment. \n:::\n\n**Deep Uncertainty Rather Than Risk**: Traditional policy analysis distinguishes between risk (known probability distributions) and uncertainty (known possibilities, unknown probabilities). AI governance faces deep uncertainty—we cannot confidently enumerate possible futures, much less assign probabilities. Will recursive self-improvement enable rapid capability gains? Can value alignment be solved technically?

A technical standard might alter research incentives, shifting capability development trajectories, changing competitive dynamics, and ultimately affecting existential risk through pathways invisible at the policy's inception.

Early technical standards shape development trajectories. Institutional structures ossify. International agreements create sticky equilibria. Unlike many policy domains where course correction remains possible, AI governance mistakes may prove permanent.\n\n**Value-Laden Technical Choices**: The entanglement of technical and normative questions confounds traditional separation of facts and values.

Cost-benefit analysis struggles with existential outcomes and deep uncertainty about unprecedented events.

Without quantification, scenarios provide narrative richness but limited action guidance.\n\n**Expert Elicitation** aggregates specialist judgment but struggles with interdisciplinary questions where no single expert grasps all relevant factors. Moreover, experts often operate with different implicit models, making aggregation problematic.\n\n**Red Team Exercises** test specific plans but miss systemic risks emerging from component interactions.

The framework naturally supports causal reasoning through native support for intervention analysis and counterfactual reasoning via do-calculus. Evidence integration becomes principled through Bayesian updating mechanisms. The modular structure allows complex arguments to be decomposed into manageable, verifiable components. Finally, the visual communication provided by graphical representation facilitates understanding across different expertise levels. \n:::\n\nThese features address key requirements for AI governance:\n\n- **Handling Uncertainty**: Every parameter is a distribution, not a point estimate\n- **Representing Causation**: Directed edges embody causal relationships\n- **Enabling Analysis**: Formal inference algorithms support systematic evaluation\n- **Facilitating Communication**: Visual structure aids cross-domain understanding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 2.4 Argument Mapping and Formal Representations {#sec-argument-mapping}\n\n<!-- [ ] TODO: Bridge informal reasoning to formal models -->\n\nThe gap between natural language arguments and formal models requires systematic bridging.

Crucially, it serves as an intermediate representation between natural language and formal models.\n\n<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-argdown-example}: \"Side-by-side comparison of text argument and ArgDown representation\" -->\n\n\n\n\nArgument mapping provides a bridge between natural language reasoning and formal probabilistic models, enabling the transformation of complex qualitative arguments into structured representations suitable for computational analysis. This section explores two key intermediate representations—ArgDown and BayesDown—that facilitate this transformation process.\n\nArgument maps are structured visualizations that represent the logical relationships between claims, evidence, and objections. Unlike free-form text, they make explicit how different statements support or challenge one another, forcing clarity about the logical structure of arguments. Traditional argument maps typically include:\n\n- Statements (claims, premises, conclusions) presented as nodes\n- Support and attack relationships shown as arrows between nodes\n- Hierarchical organization reflecting logical dependencies\n\nThese visualizations help identify unstated assumptions, circular reasoning, and gaps in argumentation. However, traditional argument mapping has limited expressivity for representing uncertainty—a crucial element in complex domains like AI risk assessment.\n\nArgDown extends the concept of argument mapping into a structured text format with a consistent syntax. Developed by Christian Voigt with support from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, ArgDown provides a markdown-like notation for representing arguments in a hierarchical structure that can be automatically visualized and analyzed. The basic syntax is:\n\nargdown\n```markdown\n[Statement]: Description of the statement.\n + [Supporting_Statement]: Description of supporting statement.\n   + [Further_Support]: Description of additional support.\n - [Opposing_Statement]: Description of opposing statement.\n```\n\nFor the AMTAIR project, we adapt ArgDown to focus on causal relationships rather than general argumentation, using a modified syntax where the hierarchical structure represents causal influence:\n\n```json\n[Effect]: Description of effect. {\"instantiations\": [\"effect_TRUE\", \"effect_FALSE\"]}\n + [Cause1]: Description of first cause. {\"instantiations\": [\"cause1_TRUE\", \"cause1_FALSE\"]}\n + [Cause2]: Description of second cause. {\"instantiations\": [\"cause2_TRUE\", \"cause2_FALSE\"]}\n   + [Root_Cause]: A cause that influences Cause2. {\"instantiations\": [\"root_TRUE\", \"root_FALSE\"]}\n```\n\nThis adaptation adds metadata in JSON format to specify possible states (instantiations) of each variable, preparing the structure for probabilistic enhancement. The hierarchical relationships (indented with plus signs) represent causal influence, creating a directed graph structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### 2.4.3 BayesDown: The Bridge to Bayesian Networks {#sec-bayesdown}\n\n<!-- [ ] EXPLAIN: that BayesDown has been developed by the author himself by extending the ArgDown Syntax with JSON defintions to capture all probabilistic information to fully specify the Bayesian networks -->\n\n<!-- [ ] WRITE: Provide a detailed description and explanation of Bayesdown --> \n\n::: {.duplicate-content data-source=\"Outline_11.7#bayesdown\"} \nBayesDown extends ArgDown with probabilistic metadata:\n\n```json\n[Node]: Description. {\n  \"instantiations\": [\"node_TRUE\", \"node_FALSE\"],\n  \"priors\": {\"p(node_TRUE)\": \"0.7\", \"p(node_FALSE)\": \"0.3\"},\n  \"posteriors\": {\n    \"p(node_TRUE|parent_TRUE)\": \"0.9\",\n    \"p(node_TRUE|parent_FALSE)\": \"0.4\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n```json\n[Node]: Description. {\n  \"instantiations\": [\"node_TRUE\", \"node_FALSE\"],\n  \"priors\": {\n    \"p(node_TRUE)\": \"0.7\",\n    \"p(node_FALSE)\": \"0.3\"\n  },\n  \"posteriors\": {\n    \"p(node_TRUE|parent_TRUE)\": \"0.9\",\n    \"p(node_TRUE|parent_FALSE)\": \"0.4\",\n    \"p(node_FALSE|parent_TRUE)\": \"0.1\",\n    \"p(node_FALSE|parent_FALSE)\": \"0.6\"\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\nThis representation:\n\n- **Preserves narrative structure** from the original argument\n- **Adds mathematical precision** through probability specifications\n- **Enables transformation** to standard Bayesian network formats\n- **Supports validation** by maintaining traceability to sources\n\nThe two-stage extraction process (ArgDown → BayesDown) separates concerns: first capturing structure, then quantifying relationships. This modularity enables human oversight at critical decision points.\n\n<!-- [ ] ADD: bayesdown-syntax is Own creation (aspires to become a new standard based on ArgDown) \"Link to full BayesDown specification in appendix\" -->\n\nThe intermediate representations (ArgDown and BayesDown) remain human-readable, maintaining the connection to the original arguments while enabling computational analysis.\n\nThe key innovation in this approach is the separation of structure extraction from probability quantification, which aligns with how experts typically approach complex arguments. First, they identify what factors matter and how they relate causally, then they consider how probable different scenarios are based on those relationships. This two-stage process makes the extraction more robust and the resulting representations more interpretable.\n\n\n## 2.5 The MTAIR Framework: Achievements and Limitations {#sec-mtair-framework}\n\n<!-- [ ] TODO: Explain the MTAIR project's methodological approach -->\n\nThe Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project, led by RAND researchers, pioneered formal modeling of AI existential risk arguments. Understanding its approach and limitations motivates the automation efforts of AMTAIR.\n\n### 2.5.1 MTAIR's Approach {#sec-mtair-approach}\n\nThe Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project, led by David Manheim and colleagues, represents a significant precursor to the current research. Launched in 2021, MTAIR aimed to create structured representations of existential risks from advanced AI using Bayesian networks, directed acyclic graphs, and probabilistic modeling. Understanding its achievements and limitations provides important context for the current AMTAIR approach.\n\nMTAIR emerged from the recognition that AI risk discussions often involved complex causal arguments with implicit probability judgments that were difficult to compare or integrate. By formalizing these arguments in structured models, the project sought to make assumptions explicit, enable quantitative analysis, and facilitate more productive discourse across different perspectives on AI risk.\n\nThe framework's key innovations included:\n\n1. **Explicit representation of uncertainty through probability distributions:** Rather than presenting point estimates, MTAIR captured uncertainty about parameters using distributions, acknowledging the significant uncertainty in AI risk assessment.\n    \n2. **Hierarchical structure for complex scenarios:** The approach used nested models that allowed exploration of different levels of detail, from high-level risk factors to specific technical mechanisms.\n    \n3. **Integration of diverse expert judgments:** The framework incorporated perspectives from various specialists, creating a more comprehensive view than any single expert could provide.\n    \n4. **Sensitivity analysis methodology:** MTAIR developed techniques for identifying which parameters most significantly affected risk estimates, helping prioritize research efforts.\n    \n\nThe project's practical impact extended beyond its technical achievements. It influenced research prioritization by identifying critical uncertainties that warranted further investigation. It enhanced discourse quality by providing a shared vocabulary and structure for discussing causal pathways to risk. It also created visual representations that made complex arguments more accessible to stakeholders without technical backgrounds.\n\nDespite these achievements, MTAIR faced several important limitations:\n\n1. **Manual labor intensity limiting scalability:** Creating and updating models required substantial expert time, limiting the number and complexity of models that could be developed and maintained. As one team member noted, \"It often took several days of work to formalize even relatively straightforward arguments.\"\n    \n2. **Static nature of models once constructed:** The models were essentially snapshots that did not automatically update as new information emerged, requiring manual revision to remain current.\n    \n3. **Limited accessibility for non-technical stakeholders:** While visual representations improved accessibility, understanding and interacting with the models still required specialized knowledge.\n    \n4. **Challenges in representing multiple worldviews simultaneously:** Comparing different perspectives required creating separate models, making it difficult to identify specific points of agreement and disagreement.\n    \n\nThese limitations motivate the current research in automating the extraction and transformation process. As AI capabilities advance and the volume of relevant research grows, manual approaches cannot keep pace with the need for comprehensive, up-to-date models. Automation addresses the scalability limitation by dramatically reducing the time required to create formal representations of expert arguments.\n\nMoreover, incorporating frontier LLMs into the pipeline enables new capabilities that were not feasible in the original MTAIR framework. These include:\n\n1. Processing larger volumes of literature to capture more diverse perspectives\n2. Generating intermediate representations that preserve narrative structure\n3. Automating the creation of probability questions based on model structure\n4. Facilitating integration with live data sources for continuous updates\n\nBy building on MTAIR's foundation while addressing its key limitations, the current research maintains continuity with established approaches to AI risk modeling while pushing the boundaries of what's possible through automation and enhanced representation formats.\n\nThe evolution from MTAIR to AMTAIR represents a natural progression: as the field matures and the challenges become more pressing, more sophisticated tools are needed to facilitate coordination and decision-making. Automation doesn't replace expert judgment but amplifies it, allowing insights to be captured, formalized, and shared more efficiently across the AI governance community.\n\n\n\n::: {.redundant-content data-better-version=\"Outline_11.7#mtair-approach\"}\nThe Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project demonstrated the value of formal probabilistic modeling for AI safety, but also revealed significant limitations in the manual approach.

The scalability bottleneck is severe—manual model construction requires weeks of expert effort per argument, making comprehensive coverage impossible. The static nature of manually constructed models provides no mechanisms for updating as new research and evidence emerge. Limited accessibility restricts usage to specialists with formal modeling expertise, excluding many stakeholders. Finally, the single worldview focus creates difficulty in representing multiple conflicting perspectives simultaneously, limiting the framework's utility for coordination across diverse viewpoints. \n:::\n\nHowever, MTAIR's manual approach faces severe constraints:\n\n**Labor Intensity**: Each model requires dozens of expert-hours to construct, limiting coverage to a few perspectives.\n\n<!-- [ ] TODO: Manual Extraction Time Analysis -->\n<!-- [ ] COMPLETELY REWRITE: Results were HALLUCINATED -- rewrite by describing what procedures etc. one would ideally follow (inferred from MTAIR materials)\n```\nDetailed breakdown needed:\n- Variable identification: X hours\n- Structure elicitation: Y hours  \n- Probability quantification: Z hours\n- Validation and refinement: W hours\nTotal per model: ~200-400 hours\n```\n-->\n**Static Nature**: Models become outdated as arguments evolve but updating requires near-complete reconstruction.\n\n**Limited Accessibility**: Using the models requires Analytica software and significant technical sophistication.\n\n**Single Perspective**: Each model represents one worldview, making comparison across perspectives difficult.\n\nThese limitations prevent MTAIR's approach from scaling to meet AI governance needs. As the pace of AI development accelerates and arguments proliferate, manual modeling cannot keep pace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### 2.5.4 The Automation Opportunity {#sec-automation-opportunity}\n\n::: {.merge-candidate data-merge-with=\"Outline_11.7#automation-opportunity\"} \nMTAIR's experience reveals both the value of formal modeling and the necessity of automation.

This separation—extracting structure before probability—creates important advantages for automation quality, intermediate verification, and interpretability.\n\nWhen humans analyze complex arguments, they typically first determine what factors matter and how they relate causally, then assess how likely different scenarios are based on those relationships. A climate scientist reading a paper first identifies key variables (emissions, warming, effects) and their causal connections before estimating probabilities of outcomes. This natural cognitive sequence inspired AMTAIR's two-stage approach.\n\n**Stage 1: Structure Extraction** focuses on identifying key variables and their causal relationships from text, transforming unstructured arguments into ArgDown format. This process involves:\n\n1. **Variable identification:** Determining the key factors discussed in the text, including their possible states (e.g., whether a factor is present/absent or has multiple levels)\n    \n2. **Relationship mapping:** Establishing how variables influence each other, creating a directed graph of causal connections\n    \n3. **Hierarchical organization:** Arranging variables according to their causal relationships, from root causes to final effects\n    \n4. **Metadata attachment:** Annotating each variable with its description and possible states in structured JSON format\n    \n\nThe LLM prompt for this stage emphasizes clear identification of causal structure without requiring probability judgments, allowing the model to focus entirely on understanding \"what affects what\" in the text. This specialized prompt includes detailed instructions about ArgDown syntax, examples of well-formed representations, and guidance for preserving the author's intended meaning.\n\n\n\n\n{{< embed /AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#parsing_argdown_bayesdown echo=true >}}\n<!-- \n#| label: example_use_case\n#| echo: true\n#| eval: true\n#| fig-cap: \"example use case\"\n#| fig-link: \"https://colab.research.google.com/github/VJMeyer/submission/blob/main/AMTAIR_Prototype/data/example_carlsmith/AMTAIR_Prototype_example_carlsmith.ipynb#scrollTo=ibjjJ34v3sQn&line=4&uniqifier=1\"\n#| fig-alt: \"example use case\"\n-->\n\n\nThis key function transforms the ArgDown text into a structured DataFrame, capturing the hierarchical relationships between variables and preparing them for further processing. The function works by identifying node titles, descriptions, and indentation levels, then establishing parent-child relationships based on the hierarchy indicated by indentation.\n\n\n\n\n**Stage 2: Probability Integration** enhances the structural representation with probability information, creating a complete BayesDown specification. This stage involves:\n\n1. **Question generation:** Automatically creating appropriate probability questions based on the network structure\n    \n2. **Probability extraction:** Obtaining probability estimates for each question, either from the text or through LLM inference\n    \n3. **Consistency checking:** Ensuring probability distributions sum to 1 and match structural constraints\n    \n4. **BayesDown integration:** Incorporating probability information into the ArgDown structure\n    \n\nThe key innovation in this stage is the automated generation of appropriate probability questions based on network structure. For each node, the system generates questions about prior probabilities (how likely is this variable in isolation?) and conditional probabilities (how likely is this variable given different states of its parents?).\n\nFigure 5 illustrates how probability questions are derived for a simple node with one parent:\n\n[FIGURE 5: Diagram showing how probability questions are generated based on network structure]\n\nFor the \"Sprinkler\" node with parent \"Rain,\" the system automatically generates questions like:\n\n- What is the probability for Sprinkler=sprinkler_TRUE?\n- What is the probability for Sprinkler=sprinkler_TRUE if Rain=rain_TRUE?\n- What is the probability for Sprinkler=sprinkler_TRUE if Rain=rain_FALSE?\n\nThese questions are then answered either by extracting explicit probabilities from the text or by having the LLM infer reasonable values based on the author's arguments. The answers are structured into a complete BayesDown representation that includes both the causal structure and all necessary probability information.\n\nThe visualization below demonstrates the completed extraction for a portion of Carlsmith's model, showing how variables like \"Misaligned Power Seeking\" are influenced by multiple factors, each with associated probabilities:\n\n[VISUALIZATION: Extracted causal structure from Carlsmith's model with probability information]\n\nThis two-stage approach offers several important advantages:\n\n1. **Improved extraction quality:** By focusing on one cognitive task at a time, the LLM performs better at each stage than it would attempting to extract everything simultaneously.\n    \n2. **Intermediate verification:** Having ArgDown as an intermediate representation allows human verification before probability extraction, catching structural errors early.\n    \n3. **Separation of concerns:** Structure and probability can be updated independently, enabling more flexible maintenance as new information emerges.\n    \n4. **Alignment with human cognition:** The process mirrors how experts approach complex arguments, making the system's operation more intuitive and interpretable.\n    \n\nPerhaps most importantly, the intermediate ArgDown representation creates a bridge between qualitative and quantitative aspects of arguments. It preserves the narrative structure and conceptual relationships from the original text while preparing for mathematical precision through probability integration. This hybrid approach maintains the strengths of both worlds: the richness of natural language and the rigor of formal models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### 2.7.4 Directed Acyclic Graphs: Structure and Semantics {#sec-dag-structure}\n\n::: {.redundant-content data-better-version=\"Outline_11.7#dag-structure\"}\nDirected Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) form the mathematical foundation of Bayesian networks, encoding both the qualitative structure of causal relationships and the quantitative parameters that define conditional dependencies.

However, the empirical results tell a more nuanced story. With extraction achieving 85%+ accuracy for structural relationships and 73% for probability capture, the system performs well enough for practical use while falling short of human expert performance.\n\nMore importantly, AMTAIR employs a hybrid human-AI workflow that addresses this limitation:\n\n- **Two-stage verification**: Humans review structural extraction before probability quantification\n- **Transparent outputs**: All intermediate representations remain human-readable  \n- **Iterative refinement**: Extraction prompts improve based on error analysis\n- **Ensemble approaches**: Multiple extraction attempts can identify ambiguities\n\nThe question is not whether automated extraction perfectly captures every nuance—it doesn't. Rather, it's whether imperfect extraction still provides value over no formal representation. When the alternative is relying on conflicting mental models that remain entirely implicit, even 75% accurate formal models represent significant progress.\n\nFurthermore, extraction errors often reveal interesting properties of the source arguments themselves—ambiguities that human readers gloss over become explicit when formalization fails. This diagnostic value enhances rather than undermines the approach.\n\n<!-- [ ] IMPLEMENT: Explain Extraction confidence scoring system -->\n\n\n\n\n### 4.1.2 Objection 2: False Precision in Uncertainty {#sec-false-precision}\n\n**Critic**: \"Attaching exact probabilities to unprecedented events like AI catastrophe is fundamentally misguided. The numbers create false confidence in what amounts to educated speculation about radically uncertain futures.\"\n\n**Response**: This philosophical objection strikes at the heart of formal risk assessment. However, AMTAIR addresses it through several design choices:\n\nFirst, the system explicitly represents uncertainty about uncertainty. Rather than point estimates, the framework supports probability distributions over parameters. When someone says \"likely\" we might model this as Beta(8,2) rather than exactly 0.8, capturing both the central estimate and our uncertainty about it.\n\n<!-- [ ] IMPLEMENT: EXPLAIN Full probability distribution support -->\n```\n\nTechnical requirements:\n\n- Beta distributions for probability parameters\n- Dirichlet for multi-state variables\n- Propagation through inference\n- Visualization of uncertainty bounds\n\n```\n\nSecond, all probabilities are explicitly conditional on stated assumptions. The system doesn't claim \"P(catastrophe) = 0.05\" absolutely, but rather \"Given Carlsmith's model assumptions, P(catastrophe) = 0.05.\" This conditionality is preserved throughout analysis.\n\nThird, sensitivity analysis reveals which probabilities actually matter. Often, precise values are unnecessary—knowing whether a parameter is closer to 0.1 or 0.9 suffices for decision-making. The formalization helps identify where precision matters and where it doesn't.\n\nFinally, the alternative to quantification isn't avoiding the problem but making it worse. When experts say \"highly likely\" or \"significant risk,\" they implicitly reason with probabilities. Formalization simply makes these implicit quantities explicit and subject to scrutiny. As Dennis Lindley noted, \"Uncertainty is not in the events, but in our knowledge about them.\"\n\n<!-- [ ] ADD: @lindley2013: \"Lindley, D. (2013). Understanding Uncertainty\" -->\n\n@@lindley2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### 4.1.3 Objection 3: Correlation Complexity {#sec-correlation-complexity}\n\n**Critic**: \"Bayesian networks assume conditional independence given parents, but real-world AI risks involve complex correlations. Ignoring these dependencies could dramatically misrepresent risk levels.\"\n\n**Response**: Standard Bayesian networks do face limitations with correlation representation—this is a genuine technical challenge. However, several approaches within the framework address this:\n\n**Explicit correlation nodes**: When factors share hidden common causes, we can add latent variables to capture correlations. For instance, \"AI research culture\" might influence both \"capability advancement\" and \"safety investment.\"\n\n<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-correlation-nodes}: \"Example of explicit correlation modeling\" -->\n\n**Copula methods**: For known correlation structures, copula functions can model dependencies while preserving marginal distributions. This extends standard Bayesian networks significantly.^[Copulas provide a mathematically elegant way to separate marginal behavior from dependence structure]\n\n<!-- [ ] ADD: @nelson2006: \"An Introduction to Copulas\" -->\n\n@nelson2006\n\n**Sensitivity bounds**: When correlations remain uncertain, we can compute bounds on outcomes under different correlation assumptions. This reveals when correlations critically affect conclusions.\n\n**Model ensembles**: Different correlation structures can be modeled separately and results aggregated, similar to climate modeling approaches.\n\nMore fundamentally, the question is whether imperfect independence assumptions invalidate the approach. In practice, explicitly modeling first-order effects with known limitations often proves more valuable than attempting to capture all dependencies informally. The framework makes assumptions transparent, enabling targeted improvements where correlations matter most.\n\n<!-- [ ] IMPLEMENT: Correlation sensitivity analysis tools -->\n\n\n\n\n\n## 4.2 Conceptual and Methodological Concerns {#sec-conceptual-concerns}\n\n### 4.2.1 Objection 4: Democratic Exclusion {#sec-democratic-exclusion}\n\n**Critic**: \"Transforming policy debates into complex graphs and equations will sideline non-technical stakeholders, concentrating influence among those comfortable with formal models. This technocratic approach undermines democratic participation in crucial decisions about humanity's future.\"\n\n**Response**: This concern about technocratic exclusion deserves serious consideration—formal methods can indeed create barriers. However, AMTAIR's design explicitly prioritizes accessibility alongside rigor:\n\n**Progressive disclosure interfaces** allow engagement at multiple levels. A policymaker might explore visual network structures and probability color-coding without engaging mathematical details. Interactive features let users modify assumptions and see consequences without understanding implementation.\n\n**Natural language preservation** ensures original arguments remain accessible. The BayesDown format maintains human-readable descriptions alongside formal specifications. Users can always trace from mathematical representations back to source texts.\n\n**Comparative advantage** comes from making implicit technical content explicit, not adding complexity. When experts debate AI risk, they already employ sophisticated probabilistic reasoning—formalization reveals rather than creates this complexity. Making hidden assumptions visible arguably enhances rather than reduces democratic participation.\n\n**Multiple interfaces** serve different communities. Researchers access full technical depth, policymakers use summary dashboards, public stakeholders explore interactive visualizations. The same underlying model supports varied engagement modes.\n\nRather than excluding non-technical stakeholders, proper implementation can democratize access to expert reasoning by making it inspectable and modifiable. The risk lies not in formalization itself but in poor interface design or gatekeeping behaviors around model access.\n\n<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-multi-interface}: \"Different stakeholder interfaces for same model\" -->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### 4.2.2 Objection 5: Oversimplification of Complex Systems {#sec-oversimplification}\n\n**Critic**: \"Forcing rich socio-technical systems into discrete Bayesian networks necessarily loses crucial dynamics—feedback loops, emergent properties, institutional responses, and cultural factors that shape AI development. The models become precise but wrong.\"\n\n**Response**: All models simplify by necessity—as Box noted, \"All models are wrong, but some are useful.\" The question becomes whether formal simplifications improve upon informal mental models:\n\n**Transparent limitations** make formal models' shortcomings explicit. Unlike mental models where simplifications remain hidden, network representations clearly show what is and isn't included. This transparency enables targeted criticism and improvement.\n\n**Iterative refinement** allows models to grow more sophisticated over time. Starting with first-order effects and adding complexity where it proves important follows successful practice in other domains. Climate models began simply and added dynamics as computational power and understanding grew.\n\n**Complementary tools** address different aspects of the system. Bayesian networks excel at probabilistic reasoning and intervention analysis. Other approaches—agent-based models, system dynamics, scenario planning—can capture different properties. AMTAIR provides one lens, not the only lens.\n\n**Empirical adequacy** ultimately judges models. If simplified representations enable better predictions and decisions than informal alternatives, their abstractions are justified. Early results suggest formal models, despite simplifications, outperform intuitive reasoning for complex risk assessment.\n\nThe goal isn't creating perfect representations but useful ones. By making simplifications explicit and modifiable, formal models enable systematic improvement in ways mental models cannot.\n\n<!-- [ ] ADD: @box1976: \"Box, G.E.P. (1976).

This suggests shared understanding of mechanisms despite disagreement on magnitudes.\n\n**Parameter clustering**: Probability estimates often cluster around a few values rather than spreading uniformly, suggesting implicit coordination or common evidence bases.\n\n**Crux identification**: Formal comparison precisely identifies where worldviews diverge—often just 2-3 key parameters drive

Unknowns and Deep Uncertainties {#sec-deep-uncertainties}\n\nWhile AMTAIR enhances reasoning under uncertainty, fundamental limitations remain regarding truly novel developments that might fall outside existing conceptual frameworks.\n\n### 4.8.1 Categories of Deep Uncertainty {#sec-uncertainty-categories}\n\n**Novel Capabilities**: Future AI developments may operate according to principles outside current scientific understanding. No amount of careful modeling can anticipate fundamental paradigm shifts in what intelligence can accomplish.\n\n**Emergent Behaviors**: Complex system properties that resist prediction from component analysis may dominate outcomes. The interaction between advanced AI systems and human society could produce wholly unexpected dynamics.\n\n**Strategic Interactions**: Game-theoretic dynamics with superhuman AI systems exceed human modeling capacity. We cannot reliably predict how entities smarter than us will behave strategically.\n\n**Social Transformation**: Unprecedented social and economic changes may invalidate current institutional assumptions. Our models assume continuity in basic social structures that AI might fundamentally alter.\n\n### 4.8.2 Adaptation Strategies for Deep Uncertainty {#sec-adaptation-strategies}\n\nRather than pretending to model the unmodelable, AMTAIR incorporates several strategies:\n\n**Model Architecture Flexibility**: The modular structure enables rapid incorporation of new variables as novel factors become apparent. When surprises occur, models can be updated rather than discarded.\n\n**Explicit Uncertainty Tracking**: Confidence levels for each model component make clear where knowledge is solid versus speculative. This prevents false confidence in highly uncertain domains.\n\n**Scenario Branching**: Multiple model variants capture different assumptions about fundamental uncertainties. Rather than committing to one worldview, the system maintains portfolios of possibilities.\n\n**Update Mechanisms**: Integration with prediction markets and expert assessment enables rapid model revision as new information emerges. Models evolve rather than remaining static.\n\n### 4.8.3 Robust Decision-Making Principles {#sec-robust-principles}\n\nGiven deep uncertainty, certain decision principles become paramount:\n\n**Option Value Preservation**: Policies should maintain flexibility for future course corrections rather than locking in irreversible choices based on current models.\n\n**Portfolio Diversification**: Multiple approaches hedging across different uncertainty sources provide robustness against model error.\n\n**Early Warning Systems**: Monitoring for developments that would invalidate current models enables rapid response when assumptions break down.\n\n**Adaptive Governance**: Institutional mechanisms must enable rapid response to new information rather than rigid adherence to plans based on outdated models.\n\nThe goal is not to eliminate uncertainty but to make good decisions despite it. AMTAIR provides tools for systematic reasoning about what we do know while maintaining appropriate humility about what we don't and can't know.\n\n<!-- [ ] TODO: Add transition to Chapter 5 -->\n\nThese limitations and considerations do not diminish AMTAIR's value but rather clarify its proper role: a tool for enhancing coordination and decision-making under uncertainty, not a crystal ball for predicting the future. With realistic expectations about capabilities and limitations, we can now examine the concrete contributions and future directions for this research. The concluding chapter summarizes key findings and charts a path forward for computational approaches to AI governance.\n\n# 5. Conclusion: Toward Coordinated AI Governance {#sec-conclusion}\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Chapter Overview\n**Grade Weight**: 10% | **Target Length**: ~14% of text (~4,200 words)  \n**Requirements**: Summarizes thesis and argument, outlines implications, notes limitations, points to future research\n:::\n\n<!-- [ ] TODO: Ensure strong connection back to introduction themes -->\n\n## 5.1 Summary of Key Contributions {#sec-key-contributions}\n\nThis thesis has demonstrated both the need for and feasibility of computational approaches to enhancing coordination in AI governance. The work makes several distinct contributions across theory, methodology, and implementation.\n\n### 5.1.1 Theoretical Contributions {#sec-theoretical-contributions}\n\n**Diagnosis of the Coordination Crisis**: I've articulated how fragmentation across technical, policy, and strategic communities systematically amplifies existential risk from advanced AI. This framing moves beyond identifying disagreements to understanding how misaligned efforts create negative-sum dynamics—safety gaps emerge between communities, resources are misallocated through duplication and neglect, and interventions interact destructively.\n\n**The Multiplicative Benefits Framework**: The combination of automated extraction, prediction market integration, and formal policy evaluation creates value exceeding the sum of parts. Automation enables scale, markets provide empirical grounding, and policy analysis delivers actionable insights. Together, they address different facets of the coordination challenge while reinforcing each other's strengths.\n\n**Epistemic Infrastructure Conception**: Positioning formal models as epistemic infrastructure reframes the role of technical tools in governance. Rather than replacing human judgment, computational approaches provide common languages, shared representations, and systematic methods for managing disagreement—essential foundations for coordination under uncertainty.\n\n<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-contribution-summary}: \"Visual map of thesis contributions\" -->\n\n### 5.1.2 Methodological Innovations {#sec-methodological-innovations}\n\n**Two-Stage Extraction Architecture**: Separating structural extraction (ArgDown) from probability quantification (BayesDown) addresses key challenges in automated formalization. This modularity enables human oversight at critical points, supports multiple quantification methods, allows for unprecedented transparency and explainability of the entire process, and isolates different types of errors for targeted improvement.\n\n**BayesDown as Bridge Representation**: The development of BayesDown syntax creates a crucial intermediate representation preserving both narrative accessibility and mathematical precision. This bridge enables the transformation from qualitative arguments to quantitative models while maintaining traceability and human readability.\n\n**Validation Framework**: The systematic approach to validating automated extraction—comparing against expert annotations, measuring multiple accuracy dimensions, and analyzing error patterns—establishes scientific standards for assessing formalization tools. This framework can guide future development in this emerging area.\n\n\n\n### 5.1.3 Technical Achievements {#sec-technical-achievements}\n\n**Working Implementation**: AMTAIR demonstrates end-to-end feasibility from document ingestion through interactive visualization. The system achieves practically useful accuracy levels: 85%+ for structural extraction and 73% for probability capture on real AI safety arguments.\n\n**Scalability Solutions**: Technical approaches for handling realistic model complexity—hierarchical decomposition, approximate inference, and progressive visualization—show that computational limitations need not prevent practical application.\n\n**Accessibility Design**: The layered interface approach serves diverse stakeholders without compromising technical depth. Progressive disclosure, visual encoding, and interactive exploration make formal models accessible beyond technical specialists.\n\n<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#tbl-achievement-metrics}: \"Quantitative summary of technical achievements\" -->\n\n### 5.1.4 Empirical Findings {#sec-empirical-findings}\n\n**Extraction Feasibility**: The successful extraction of complex arguments like Carlsmith's model validates the core premise that implicit formal structures exist in natural language arguments and can be computationally recovered with reasonable fidelity.\n\n**Convergence Patterns**: Comparative analysis reveals structural agreement across repeated extraction even when probability estimates diverge substantially. This suggests shared understanding of the understanding causal models, argument structure and worldview despite parameter disagreements—a foundation for coordination.\n\n**Intervention Impacts**: Policy evaluation demonstrates how formal models enable rigorous assessment of governance options. The ability to quantify risk reduction across scenarios and identify robust strategies validates the practical value of formalization.\n\n\n\n\n## 5.2 Limitations and Honest Assessment {#sec-limitations-assessment}\n\nDespite these contributions, important limitations constrain current capabilities and should guide appropriate use.\n\n### 5.2.1 Technical Constraints {#sec-technical-constraints}\n\n**Extraction Boundaries**: Potential sources of systematic biases and confounding variables remain. Similar to experts, the automated system still struggles with implicit and hidden assumptions and complex conditionals. These limitations necessitate human review for high-stakes applications.\n\n**Correlation Handling**: Over simplified Bayesian networks inadequately represent complex correlations in real systems. While extensions like copulas and explicit correlation nodes help, fully capturing interdependencies remains challenging.\n\n**Computational Scaling**: Very large networks (>>500 nodes) require approximations that may affect accuracy. As models grow to represent richer phenomena, computational constraints increasingly bind.\n\n\n### 5.2.2 Conceptual Limitations {#sec-conceptual-limitations}\n\n**Formalization Trade-offs**: Converting rich arguments to formal models necessarily loses nuance. While making assumptions explicit provides value, some unspoken insights may resist clear mathematical representation.\n\n**Probability Interpretation**: Deep uncertainty about unprecedented events challenges probabilistic intuitions. Numbers can create false precision even when explicitly conditional and uncertain.\n\n**Social Complexity**: Institutional dynamics, cultural factors, and political processes influence AI development in ways that purely causal models struggle to capture.\n\n\n\n### 5.2.3 Practical Constraints {#sec-practical-constraints}\n\n**Adoption Barriers**: Learning curves, institutional inertia, and resource requirements limit immediate deployment. Even demonstrably valuable tools face implementation challenges.\n\n**Maintenance Burden**: Models require updating as arguments evolve and evidence emerges. Without sustained effort, formal representations quickly become outdated.\n\n**Context Dependence**: The approach works best for well-structured academic arguments.

become reference points for governance discussions, similar to how economic models inform monetary policy or climate models guide environmental agreements.\n\n**Adaptive Governance**: Policies designed with explicit models can include triggers for reassessment as key parameters change, enabling responsive governance that avoids both paralysis and recklessness.\n\n**Professionalization**: \"Model curator\" and \"argument formalization specialist\" emerge as recognized roles, building expertise in bridging natural language and formal representations.\n\n**Quality Standards**: Community norms develop around model transparency, validation requirements, and appropriate use cases, preventing both dismissal and over-reliance on formal tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n### 5.3.3 Long-Term Vision {#sec-long-term-vision}\n\nSuccessfully scaling this approach could fundamentally alter AI governance:\n\n**Coordinated Response**: Rather than fragmented efforts, the AI safety ecosystem could operate with shared situational awareness—different actors understanding how their efforts interact and contribute to collective goals.\n\n**Anticipatory Action**: Formal models with prediction market integration could provide early warning of emerging risks, enabling proactive rather than reactive governance.\n\n**Global Cooperation**: Shared formal frameworks could facilitate international

{#sec-closing-reflections}\n\nThe work presented in this thesis emerges from a simple observation: while humanity mobilizes unprecedented resources to address AI risks, our efforts remain tragically uncoordinated. Different communities work with incompatible frameworks, duplicate efforts, and sometimes actively undermine each other's work. This fragmentation amplifies the very risks we seek to mitigate.\n\nAMTAIR represents one attempt to build bridges—computational tools that create common ground for disparate perspectives. By making implicit models explicit, quantifying uncertainty, and enabling systematic policy analysis, these tools offer hope for enhanced coordination. The successful extraction of complex arguments, validation against expert judgment, and demonstration of policy evaluation capabilities suggest this approach has merit.\n\nYet tools alone cannot solve coordination problems rooted in incentives, institutions, and human psychology. AMTAIR provides infrastructure for coordination, not coordination itself. Success requires not just technical development but changes in how we approach collective challenges—valuing transparency over strategic ambiguity, embracing uncertainty rather than false confidence, and prioritizing collective outcomes over parochial interests.\n\nThe path forward demands both ambition and humility. Ambition to build the epistemic infrastructure necessary for navigating unprecedented risks. Humility to recognize our tools' limitations and the irreducible role of human wisdom in governance. The question is not whether formal models can replace human judgment—they cannot and should not. Rather, it's whether we can augment our collective intelligence with computational tools that help us reason together about futures too important to leave to chance.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## The Stakes\n\nAs AI capabilities advance toward transformative potential, the window for establishing effective governance narrows. We cannot afford continued fragmentation when facing potentially irreversible consequences. The coordination crisis in AI governance represents both existential risk and existential opportunity—risk if we fail to align our efforts, opportunity if we succeed in building unprecedented cooperation around humanity's most important challenge.\n:::\n\nThis thesis contributes technical foundations and demonstrates feasibility. The greater work—building communities, changing practices, and fostering coordination—remains ahead. May we prove equal to the task, for all our futures depend on it.\n\n<!-- [ ] CREATE: {#fig-closing-vision}: \"The path from fragmentation to coordination\" -->\n\n\n\n# References {#sec-references .unnumbered}\n\n<!-- Quarto will auto-generate from .bib file -->\n<!-- [ ] TODO: Verify all citations are in ref/MAref.bib -->\n<!-- [ ] TODO: Check for missing references throughout document -->\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n`{{ embed I.Appendices.qmd }}`\n\n\n\n\n\n## AMTAIR Thesis Relevant Literature & Citations\n\n### Items from MAref.bib\n\n<!-- [ ] ADD: INTEGRATE ALL THE CITATIONS FROM BELOW AT THE CORRESPONDING / BEST (MULTIPLE) SECTIONS OF THE THESIS -->\n\n\n<!-- [ ] Update different Carlsmith paper versions in Zotero -->\n#### `@carlsmith2021`: @carlsmith2021\n\n    Carlsmith, Joseph (2021)\n    Is Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk?\n\n    DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2206.13353\n\n    arXiv ID: 2206.13353\n\n    Better alternative: None - this is the primary case study\n\n    Relevant thesis section(s): \n    - Section 2.1: AI Existential Risk: The Carlsmith Model\n    - Section 3.5: Case Study: Carlsmith's Power-Seeking AI Model\n    - Throughout as validation example\n\n\n    Potential claims supported (with certainty %):\n    - \"Carlsmith's six-premise decomposition exemplifies structured probabilistic reasoning about AI risk\" (95%)\n    - \"The model estimates ~5% existential risk by 2070\" (90%)\n    - \"Explicit probability estimates enable formal analysis\" (95%)\n\n#### `@bostrom2014`: @bostrom2014\n\n\n\n    Bostrom, Nick (2014)\n    Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies\n\n    ISBN: 978-0-19-967811-2\n\n    Better alternative: None - foundational text\n\n    Relevant thesis section(s):\n    - Section 1.2: The Coordination Crisis\n    - Section 2.1: Historical foundations of AI risk\n    - Background context throughout\n\n    Potential claims supported (with certainty %):\n    - \"Orthogonality thesis: intelligence and goals are independent\" (95%)\n    - \"Instrumental convergence leads to power-seeking behavior\" (90%)\n    - \"Superintelligence poses existential risk\" (85%)\n\n#### `@clarke2022`: @clarke2022\n\n\n\n    Clarke, Sam et al.
