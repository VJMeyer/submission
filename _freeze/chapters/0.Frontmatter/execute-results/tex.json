AMTAIR automation pipeline from PDFs to Bayesian networks\" \n  fig-alt=\"FLOWCHART: Five-step automation pipeline workflow for AMTAIR project.\n          DATA: The pipeline transforms PDFs through ArgDown, BayesDown, CSV, and HTML into Bayesian network visualizations.\n          PURPOSE: Illustrates the core technical process that enables automated extraction of probabilistic models from AI safety literature.\n          DETAILS: Five numbered green steps show: (1) LLM-based extraction from PDFs to ArgDown, (2) ArgDown to BayesDown completion with probabilities, (3) Extracting world-models as CSV data, (4) Software tools for data inference, and (5) Visualization of the resulting Bayesian network.\n          Each step includes example outputs, with the final visualization showing a Rain-Sprinkler-Grass Wet Bayesian network with probability tables.\n          SOURCE: Created by the author to explain the AMTAIR methodology\n          \"\n  fig-align=\"center\" \n

paragraphs (one idea per paragraph)  \n- simplicity  \n- \\!limit use of passive voice\\!  \n- use active voice, even prefer I over we\\!  \n- minimise use of “zombi nouns” (don’t turn verbs/adjectives to nouns\\!)  \n- “find words that can be cut”\n\n– the paper can **focus** on **one aspect of the presentation**\n\n– “open door policy” for (content) questions\n\n\\~ demonstrate ability for novel research\n\n– “solve research question with the tools accessible to you”\n\n– “show something that has not been shown before / should be publishable in principle”\n\n– new idea (or criticism) “in this field” \n\n– Outline idea THEN reading with a purpose (answering concrete questions)\n\n– “Only” confirm that nobody has published the exact same idea on the same topic\n\n– pretty much determined by presentation & proposal but narrow down further (& choose supervisor?)\n\n\n\n### Quarto Features Incompatible with LaTeX (Below) {.unnumbered .unlisted}\n\n<!-- [ ] Trouble shoot
