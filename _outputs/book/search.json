The work emerged from recognizing a fundamental challenge in AI governance: while investment in AI safety research has grown exponentially, coordination between different stakeholder communities remains fragmented, potentially increasing existential risk through misaligned efforts.\nI hope this work contributes to building the intellectual and technical infrastructure necessary for humanity to navigate the transition to transformative AI safely. The tools and frameworks presented here are offered in the spirit of collaborative problem-solving, recognizing that the challenges we face require unprecedented cooperation across disciplines, institutions, and worldviews.\nI thank my supervisor Dr. Timo Speith for guidance throughout this project, the MTAIR team for pioneering the manual approach that inspired automation, and the AI safety community for creating the rich literature that made this work possible. Special recognition goes to technical advisors who provided implementation feedback and domain experts who validated extraction results.\nThis research was conducted with support from [funding sources] and benefited from computational resources provided by [institutions].

    "text": "1.1 Opening Scenario: The Policymaker’s Dilemma\n\n\nImagine a senior policy advisor preparing recommendations for AI governance legislation. On her desk lie a dozen reports from leading AI safety researchers, each painting a different picture of the risks ahead. One argues that misaligned AI could pose existential risks within the decade, citing complex technical arguments about instrumental convergence and orthogonality. Another suggests these concerns are overblown, emphasizing uncertainty and the strength of existing institutions. A third proposes specific technical standards but acknowledges deep uncertainty about their effectiveness.\n\nEach report seems compelling in isolation, written by credentialed experts with sophisticated arguments. Yet they reach dramatically different conclusions about both the magnitude of risk and appropriate interventions. The technical arguments involve unfamiliar concepts—mesa-optimization, corrigibility, capability amplification—expressed through different frameworks and implicit assumptions. Time is limited, stakes are high, and the legislation could shape humanity’s trajectory for decades.\n\nThis scenario plays out daily across government offices, corporate boardrooms, and research institutions worldwide. It exemplifies what I term the “coordination crisis” in AI governance: despite unprecedented attention and resources directed toward AI safety, we lack the epistemic infrastructure to synthesize diverse expert knowledge into actionable governance strategies.",

    "section": "1.2 The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance",
    "text": "1.2 The Coordination Crisis in AI Governance\n\n\n\nAs AI capabilities advance at an accelerating pace—demonstrated by the rapid progression from GPT-3 to GPT-4, Claude, and emerging multimodal systems—humanity faces a governance challenge unlike any in history. The task of ensuring increasingly powerful AI systems remain aligned with human values and beneficial to our long-term flourishing grows more urgent with each capability breakthrough. This challenge becomes particularly acute when considering transformative AI systems that could drastically alter civilization’s trajectory, potentially including existential risks from misaligned systems pursuing objectives counter to human welfare.\n\nDespite unprecedented investment in AI safety research, rapidly growing awareness among key stakeholders, and proliferating frameworks for responsible AI development, we face what I’ll term the “coordination crisis” in AI governance—a systemic failure to align diverse efforts across technical, policy, and strategic domains into a coherent response proportionate to the risks we face.\n\nThe current state of AI governance presents a striking paradox. On one hand, we witness extraordinary mobilization: billions in research funding, proliferating safety initiatives, major tech companies establishing alignment teams, and governments worldwide developing AI strategies. The Asilomar AI Principles garnered thousands of signatures, the EU advances comprehensive AI regulation , and technical researchers produce increasingly sophisticated work on alignment, interpretability, and robustness.\n\n\n\nYet alongside this activity, we observe systematic coordination failures that may prove catastrophic. Technical safety researchers develop sophisticated alignment techniques without clear implementation pathways. Policy specialists craft regulatory frameworks lacking technical grounding to ensure practical efficacy. Ethicists articulate normative principles that lack operational specificity. Strategy researchers identify critical uncertainties but struggle to translate these into actionable guidance. International bodies convene without shared frameworks for assessing interventions.\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Safety Gaps from Misaligned Efforts\n\nThe fragmentation problem manifests in incompatible frameworks between technical researchers, policy specialists, and strategic analysts. Each community develops sophisticated approaches within their domain, yet translation between domains remains primitive. This creates systematic blind spots where risks emerge at the interfaces between technical capabilities, institutional responses, and strategic dynamics.\nWhen different communities operate with incompatible frameworks, critical risks fall through the cracks. Technical researchers may solve alignment problems under assumptions that policymakers’ decisions invalidate. Regulations optimized for current systems may inadvertently incentivize dangerous development patterns. Without shared models of the risk landscape, our collective efforts resemble the parable of blind men describing an elephant—each accurate within their domain but missing the complete picture.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Resource Misallocation\n\nThe AI safety community duplicates efforts while leaving critical areas underexplored. Multiple teams independently develop similar frameworks without building on each other’s work. Funders struggle to identify high-impact opportunities across technical and governance domains. Talent flows toward well-publicized approaches while neglected strategies remain understaffed. This misallocation becomes more costly as the window for establishing effective governance narrows.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Negative-Sum Dynamics\n\nPerhaps most concerning, uncoordinated interventions can actively increase risk. Safety standards that advantage established players may accelerate risky development elsewhere. Partial transparency requirements might enable capability advances without commensurate safety improvements. International agreements lacking shared technical understanding may lock in dangerous practices. Without coordination, our cure risks becoming worse than the disease.\n\nCoordination failures systematically amplify existential risk through multiple pathways. Safety gaps emerge when technical solutions lack policy implementation pathways. Resource misallocation occurs when multiple teams unknowingly duplicate efforts while critical areas remain unaddressed. Most perniciously, locally optimized decisions by individual actors can create negative-sum dynamics that increase overall risk—an AI governance tragedy of the commons.",

The nuclear age began with scientists racing to understand and control forces that could destroy civilization. Early coordination failures—competing national programs, scientist-military tensions, public-expert divides—nearly led to catastrophe multiple times. Only through developing shared frameworks (deterrence theory), institutions (IAEA), and communication channels (hotlines, treaties) did humanity navigate the nuclear precipice.\n\n\n\nYet AI presents unique coordination challenges that compress our response timeline:\nAccelerating Development: Unlike nuclear weapons requiring massive infrastructure, AI development proceeds in corporate labs and academic departments worldwide. Capability improvements come through algorithmic insights and computational scale, both advancing exponentially.\nDual-Use Ubiquity: Every AI advance potentially contributes to both beneficial applications and catastrophic risks. The same language model architectures enabling scientific breakthroughs could facilitate dangerous manipulation or deception at scale.\nComprehension Barriers: Nuclear risks were viscerally understandable—cities vaporized, radiation sickness, nuclear winter. AI risks involve abstract concepts like optimization processes, goal misspecification, and emergent capabilities that resist intuitive understanding.\nGovernance Lag: Traditional governance mechanisms—legislation, international treaties, professional standards—operate on timescales of years to decades. AI capabilities advance on timescales of months to years, creating an ever-widening capability-governance gap.",

    "text": "1.5 The Multiplicative Benefits Framework\n\nThe central thesis of this work is that combining three elements—automated worldview extraction, prediction market integration, and formal policy evaluation—creates multiplicative rather than merely additive benefits for AI governance. Each component enhances the others, creating a system more valuable than the sum of its parts.\n\n\n1.5.1 Automated Worldview Extraction\n\nAutomated worldview extraction using frontier language models addresses the scaling bottleneck in current approaches to AI risk modeling. The Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project demonstrated the value of formal representation but required extensive manual effort to translate qualitative arguments into quantitative models. Automation enables processing orders of magnitude more content, incorporating diverse perspectives, and maintaining models in near real-time as new arguments emerge.\n\nCurrent approaches to AI risk modeling, exemplified by the Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project, demonstrate the value of formal representation but require extensive manual effort. Creating a single model demands hundreds of expert-hours to translate qualitative arguments into quantitative frameworks. This bottleneck severely limits the number of perspectives that can be formalized and the speed of model updates as new arguments emerge.\n\nAutomation using frontier language models addresses this scaling challenge. By developing systematic methods to extract causal structures and probability judgments from natural language, we can:\n\nProcess orders of magnitude more content\nIncorporate diverse perspectives rapidly\nMaintain models that evolve with the discourse\nReduce barriers to entry for contributing worldviews\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Live Data Integration\n\nPrediction market integration grounds these models in collective forecasting intelligence. By connecting formal representations to live forecasting platforms, the system can incorporate timely judgments about critical uncertainties from calibrated forecasters. This creates a dynamic feedback loop where models inform forecasters and forecasts update models.\n\nStatic models, however well-constructed, quickly become outdated in fast-moving domains. Prediction markets and forecasting platforms aggregate distributed knowledge about uncertain futures, providing continuously updated probability estimates. By connecting formal models to these live data sources, we create dynamic assessments that incorporate the latest collective intelligence.\nThis integration serves multiple purposes:\n\nGrounding abstract models in empirical forecasts\nIdentifying which uncertainties most affect outcomes\nRevealing when model assumptions diverge from collective expectations\nGenerating new questions for forecasting communities\n\n\n\n\n1.5.3 Formal Policy Evaluation\nFormal policy evaluation transforms static risk assessments into actionable guidance by modeling how specific interventions alter critical parameters. Using causal inference techniques, we can assess not just the probability of adverse outcomes but how those probabilities change under different policy regimes.\nThis enables genuinely evidence-based policy development:\n\nComparing interventions across multiple worldviews\nIdentifying robust strategies that work across scenarios\nUnderstanding which uncertainties most affect policy effectiveness\nPrioritizing research to reduce decision-relevant uncertainty\n\n\n\n\n1.5.4 The Synergy\n\nThe synergy emerges because automation enables comprehensive data integration, markets inform and validate models, and evaluation gains precision from both automated extraction and market-based calibration. The complete system creates feedback loops where policy analysis identifies critical uncertainties for market attention.\n\nThe multiplicative benefits emerge from the interactions between components:\n\nAutomation enables comprehensive coverage, making prediction market integration more valuable by connecting to more perspectives\nMarket data validates and calibrates automated extractions, improving quality\nPolicy evaluation gains precision from both comprehensive models and live probability updates\nThe complete system creates feedback loops where policy analysis identifies critical uncertainties for market attention\n\nThis synergistic combination addresses the coordination crisis by providing common ground for disparate communities, translating between technical and policy languages, quantifying previously implicit disagreements, and enabling evidence-based compromise.",

    "text": "2.1 AI Existential Risk: The Carlsmith Model\n\n\nCarlsmith’s “Is Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk?” (2021) represents one of the most structured approaches to assessing the probability of existential catastrophe from advanced AI. The analysis decomposes the overall risk into six key premises, each with an explicit probability estimate.\n\nTo ground our discussion in concrete terms, I examine Joseph Carlsmith’s “Is Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk?” as an exemplar of structured reasoning about AI catastrophic risk. Carlsmith’s analysis stands out for its explicit probabilistic decomposition of the path from current AI development to potential existential catastrophe.\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Six-Premise Decomposition\n\nCarlsmith decomposes existential risk into a probabilistic chain with explicit estimates:\n\nPremise 1: Transformative AI development this century (P ≈ 0.80)\nPremise 2: AI systems pursuing objectives in the world (P ≈ 0.95)\nPremise 3: Systems with power-seeking instrumental incentives (P ≈ 0.40)\nPremise 4: Sufficient capability for existential threat (P ≈ 0.65)\nPremise 5: Misaligned systems despite safety efforts (P ≈ 0.50)\nPremise 6: Catastrophic outcomes from misaligned power-seeking (P ≈ 0.65)\n\nComposite Risk Calculation: P(doom) ≈ 0.05 (5%)\n\nCarlsmith structures his argument through six conditional premises, each assigned explicit probability estimates:\nPremise 1: APS Systems by 2070 (P ≈ 0.65)1 “By 2070, there will be AI systems with Advanced capability, Agentic planning, and Strategic awareness”—the conjunction of capabilities that could enable systematic pursuit of objectives in the world.\nPremise 2: Alignment Difficulty (P ≈ 0.40)\n“It will be harder to build aligned APS systems than misaligned systems that are still attractive to deploy”—capturing the challenge that safety may conflict with capability or efficiency.\nPremise 3: Deployment Despite Misalignment (P ≈ 0.70)\n“Conditional on 1 and 2, we will deploy misaligned APS systems”—reflecting competitive pressures and limited coordination.\nPremise 4: Power-Seeking Behavior (P ≈ 0.65)\n“Conditional on 1-3, misaligned APS systems will seek power in high-impact ways”—based on instrumental convergence arguments.\nPremise 5: Disempowerment Success (P ≈ 0.40)\n“Conditional on 1-4, power-seeking will scale to permanent human disempowerment”—despite potential resistance and safeguards.\nPremise 6: Existential Catastrophe (P ≈ 0.95)\n“Conditional on 1-5, this disempowerment constitutes existential catastrophe”—connecting power loss to permanent curtailment of human potential.\nOverall Risk: Multiplying through the conditional chain yields P(doom) ≈ 0.05 or 5% by 2070.\nThis structured approach exemplifies the type of reasoning AMTAIR aims to formalize and automate. While Carlsmith spent months developing this model manually, similar rigor exists implicitly in many AI safety arguments awaiting extraction.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Why Carlsmith Exemplifies Formalizable Arguments\n\nCarlsmith’s model represents “low-hanging fruit” for automated formalization because it already exhibits explicit probabilistic reasoning with clear conditional dependencies. Success with this structured argument validates the approach for less explicit arguments throughout AI safety literature.\n\nCarlsmith’s model demonstrates several features that make it ideal for formal representation:\nExplicit Probabilistic Structure: Each premise receives numerical probability estimates with documented reasoning, enabling direct translation to Bayesian network parameters.\nClear Conditional Dependencies: The logical flow from capabilities through deployment decisions to catastrophic outcomes maps naturally onto directed acyclic graphs.\nTransparent Decomposition: Breaking the argument into modular premises allows independent evaluation and sensitivity analysis of each component.\nDocumented Reasoning: Extensive justification for each probability enables extraction of both structure and parameters from the source text.",

    "text": "2.2 The Epistemic Challenge of Policy Evaluation\n\nAI governance policy evaluation faces unique epistemic challenges that render traditional policy analysis methods insufficient. Understanding these challenges motivates the need for new computational approaches.\n\n2.2.1 Unique Characteristics of AI Governance\n\nAI governance policy evaluation faces unique epistemic challenges that render traditional policy analysis methods insufficient. The domain combines complex causal chains with limited empirical grounding, deep uncertainty about future capabilities, divergent stakeholder worldviews, and few opportunities for experimental testing before deployment.\n\nDeep Uncertainty Rather Than Risk: Traditional policy analysis distinguishes between risk (known probability distributions) and uncertainty (known possibilities, unknown probabilities). AI governance faces deep uncertainty—we cannot confidently enumerate possible futures, much less assign probabilities. Will recursive self-improvement enable rapid capability gains? Can value alignment be solved technically? These foundational questions resist empirical resolution before their answers become catastrophically relevant.\nComplex Multi-Level Causation: Policy effects propagate through technical, institutional, and social levels with intricate feedback loops. A technical standard might alter research incentives, shifting capability development trajectories, changing competitive dynamics, and ultimately affecting existential risk through pathways invisible at the policy’s inception. Traditional linear causal models cannot capture these dynamics.\nIrreversibility and Lock-In: Many AI governance decisions create path dependencies that prove difficult or impossible to reverse. Early technical standards shape development trajectories. Institutional structures ossify. International agreements create sticky equilibria. Unlike many policy domains where course correction remains possible, AI governance mistakes may prove permanent.\nValue-Laden Technical Choices: The entanglement of technical and normative questions confounds traditional separation of facts and values. What constitutes “alignment”? How much capability development should we risk for economic benefits? Technical specifications embed ethical judgments that resist neutral expertise.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Limitations of Traditional Approaches\n\nTraditional methods fall short in several ways. Cost-benefit analysis struggles with existential outcomes and deep uncertainty about unprecedented events. Scenario planning often lacks the probabilistic reasoning necessary for rigorous evaluation under uncertainty. Expert elicitation alone fails to formalize interdependencies between variables and make assumptions explicit. Qualitative approaches obscure crucial assumptions that drive conclusions, making it difficult to identify cruxes of disagreement.\n\nStandard policy evaluation tools prove inadequate for these challenges:\nCost-Benefit Analysis assumes commensurable outcomes and stable probability distributions. When potential outcomes include existential catastrophe with deeply uncertain probabilities, the mathematical machinery breaks down. Infinite negative utility resists standard decision frameworks.\nScenario Planning helps explore possible futures but typically lacks the probabilistic reasoning needed for decision-making under uncertainty. Without quantification, scenarios provide narrative richness but limited action guidance.\nExpert Elicitation aggregates specialist judgment but struggles with interdisciplinary questions where no single expert grasps all relevant factors. Moreover, experts often operate with different implicit models, making aggregation problematic.\nRed Team Exercises test specific plans but miss systemic risks emerging from component interactions. Gaming individual failures cannot reveal emergent catastrophic possibilities.\nThese limitations create a methodological gap: we need approaches that handle deep uncertainty, represent complex causation, quantify expert disagreement, and enable systematic exploration of intervention effects.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Toward New Epistemic Tools\n\nThe inadequacy of traditional methods for AI governance creates an urgent need for new epistemic tools. These tools must:\n\nHandle Deep Uncertainty: Move beyond point estimates to represent ranges of possibilities\nCapture Complex Causation: Model multi-level interactions and feedback loops\nQuantify Disagreement: Make explicit where experts diverge and why\nEnable Systematic Analysis: Support rigorous comparison of policy options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Insight\n\n\n\nThe computational approaches developed in this thesis—particularly Bayesian networks enhanced with automated extraction—directly address each of these requirements by providing formal frameworks for reasoning under uncertainty.",

They provide explicit uncertainty representation where all beliefs are represented with probability distributions rather than point estimates. The framework naturally supports causal reasoning through native support for intervention analysis and counterfactual reasoning via do-calculus. Evidence integration becomes principled through Bayesian updating mechanisms. The modular structure allows complex arguments to be decomposed into manageable, verifiable components. Finally, the visual communication provided by graphical representation facilitates understanding across different expertise levels.\n\nThese features address key requirements for AI governance:\n\nHandling Uncertainty: Every parameter is a distribution, not a point estimate\nRepresenting Causation: Directed edges embody causal relationships\nEnabling Analysis: Formal inference algorithms support systematic evaluation\nFacilitating Communication: Visual structure aids cross-domain understanding",

Understanding its approach and limitations motivates the automation efforts of AMTAIR.\n\n2.5.1 MTAIR’s Approach\n\nThe Modeling Transformative AI Risks (MTAIR) project demonstrated the value of formal probabilistic modeling for AI safety, but also revealed significant limitations in the manual approach. While MTAIR successfully translated complex arguments into Bayesian networks and enabled sensitivity analysis, the intensive human labor required for model creation limited both scalability and timeliness.\n\nMTAIR manually translated influential AI risk arguments into Bayesian networks using Analytica software:\nSystematic Decomposition: Breaking complex arguments into variables and relationships through expert analysis.\nProbability Elicitation: Gathering quantitative estimates through structured expert interviews and literature review.\nSensitivity Analysis: Identifying which parameters most influence conclusions about AI risk levels.\nVisual Communication: Creating interactive models that stakeholders could explore and modify.\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Key Achievements\nMTAIR demonstrated several important possibilities:\nFeasibility of Formalization: Complex philosophical arguments about AI risk can be represented as Bayesian networks while preserving essential insights.\nValue of Quantification: Moving from qualitative concerns to quantitative models enables systematic analysis, comparison, and prioritization.\nCross-Perspective Communication: Formal models provide common ground for technical and policy communities to engage productively.\nResearch Prioritization: Sensitivity analysis reveals which empirical questions would most reduce uncertainty about AI risks.\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Fundamental Limitations\n\nDespite its innovations, MTAIR faces fundamental limitations that motivate the automated approach. The scalability bottleneck is severe—manual model construction requires weeks of expert effort per argument, making comprehensive coverage impossible. The static nature of manually constructed models provides no mechanisms for updating as new research and evidence emerge. Limited accessibility restricts usage to specialists with formal modeling expertise, excluding many stakeholders. Finally, the single worldview focus creates difficulty in representing multiple conflicting perspectives simultaneously, limiting the framework’s utility for coordination across diverse viewpoints.\n\nHowever, MTAIR’s manual approach faces severe constraints:\nLabor Intensity: Each model requires hundreds of expert-hours to construct, limiting coverage to a few perspectives.\n\nDetailed breakdown needed:\n- Variable identification: X hours\n- Structure elicitation: Y hours  \n- Probability quantification: Z hours\n- Validation and refinement: W hours\nTotal per model: ~200-400 hours\nStatic Nature: Models become outdated as arguments evolve but updating requires near-complete reconstruction.\nLimited Accessibility: Using the models requires Analytica software and significant technical sophistication.\nSingle Perspective: Each model represents one worldview, making comparison across perspectives difficult.\nThese limitations prevent MTAIR’s approach from scaling to meet AI governance needs. As the pace of AI development accelerates and arguments proliferate, manual modeling cannot keep pace.\n\n\n2.5.4 The Automation Opportunity\n\nMTAIR’s experience reveals both the value of formal modeling and the necessity of automation. Key lessons:\n\nFormal models genuinely enhance understanding and coordination\nThe modeling process itself surfaces implicit assumptions\nQuantification enables analyses impossible with qualitative arguments alone\nBut manual approaches cannot scale to match the challenge\n\n\nThis motivates AMTAIR’s central innovation: using frontier language models to automate the extraction and formalization process while preserving the benefits MTAIR demonstrated.",

For the complex networks representing AI risks, computational approaches must balance accuracy with tractability.\nInference methods implemented include exact methods for smaller networks (variable elimination, junction trees), approximate methods for larger networks (Monte Carlo sampling, variational inference), specialized approaches for rare event analysis, and intervention modeling for policy evaluation using do-calculus.\n\nImplementation considerations:\n\nComputational Complexity: Managing exponential growth through decomposition\nSampling Efficiency: Importance sampling for rare events\nApproximation Quality: Convergence diagnostics and error bounds\nUncertainty Propagation: Representing confidence in outputs\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7.7 Integration with Prediction Markets and Forecasting Platforms\nTo maintain relevance in a rapidly evolving field, formal models must integrate with live data sources such as prediction markets and forecasting platforms.\n\nLive data sources for dynamic model updating include:\n\nMetaculus: Long-term AI predictions and technological forecasting\nGood Judgment Open: Geopolitical events and policy outcomes\nManifold Markets: Diverse question types with rapid market response\nInternal Expert Forecasting: Organization-specific predictions and assessments\n\n\nThe data processing pipeline:\npython\ndef integrate_forecast_data(model_variables, forecast_platforms):\n    \"\"\"Connect Bayesian network variables to live forecasting data\"\"\"\n    mappings = create_semantic_mappings(model_variables, forecast_platforms)\n    \n    for variable, forecasts in mappings.items():\n        weighted_forecast = aggregate_forecasts(\n            forecasts, \n            weights=calculate_track_record_weights(forecasts)\n        )\n        model.update_prior(variable, weighted_forecast)\n    \n    return model.recompute_posteriors()\nTechnical challenges:\n\nQuestion Mapping: Semantic matching between model variables and market questions\nTemporal Alignment: Different forecast horizons and update frequencies\nConflict Resolution: Principled aggregation of contradictory sources\nTrack Record Weighting: Incorporating forecaster calibration\n\n\nWith these theoretical foundations and methodological approaches established, we can now present the AMTAIR system implementation. The next chapter demonstrates how these concepts translate into a working prototype that automates the extraction and formalization of world models from AI safety literature.",

    "section": "4.1 Technical Limitations and Responses",
    "text": "4.1 Technical Limitations and Responses\n\n4.1.1 Objection 1: Extraction Quality Boundaries\n\nCritic: “Complex implicit reasoning chains resist formalization; automated extraction will systematically miss nuanced arguments and subtle conditional relationships that human experts would identify.”\n\nResponse: This concern has merit—extraction does face inherent limitations. However, the empirical results tell a more nuanced story. With extraction achieving 85%+ accuracy for structural relationships and 73% for probability capture, the system performs well enough for practical use while falling short of human expert performance.\nMore importantly, AMTAIR employs a hybrid human-AI workflow that addresses this limitation:\n\nTwo-stage verification: Humans review structural extraction before probability quantification\nTransparent outputs: All intermediate representations remain human-readable\n\nIterative refinement: Extraction prompts improve based on error analysis\nEnsemble approaches: Multiple extraction attempts can identify ambiguities\n\nThe question is not whether automated extraction perfectly captures every nuance—it doesn’t. Rather, it’s whether imperfect extraction still provides value over no formal representation. When the alternative is relying on conflicting mental models that remain entirely implicit, even 75% accurate formal models represent significant progress.\nFurthermore, extraction errors often reveal interesting properties of the source arguments themselves—ambiguities that human readers gloss over become explicit when formalization fails. This diagnostic value enhances rather than undermines the approach.\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Objection 2: False Precision in Uncertainty\nCritic: “Attaching exact probabilities to unprecedented events like AI catastrophe is fundamentally misguided. The numbers create false confidence in what amounts to educated speculation about radically uncertain futures.”\nResponse: This philosophical objection strikes at the heart of formal risk assessment. However, AMTAIR addresses it through several design choices:\nFirst, the system explicitly represents uncertainty about uncertainty. Rather than point estimates, the framework supports probability distributions over parameters. When someone says “likely” we might model this as Beta(8,2) rather than exactly 0.8, capturing both the central estimate and our uncertainty about it.\n\n\nTechnical requirements:\n\n- Beta distributions for probability parameters\n- Dirichlet for multi-state variables\n- Propagation through inference\n- Visualization of uncertainty bounds\n\nSecond, all probabilities are explicitly conditional on stated assumptions. The system doesn’t claim “P(catastrophe) = 0.05” absolutely, but rather “Given Carlsmith’s model assumptions, P(catastrophe) = 0.05.” This conditionality is preserved throughout analysis.\nThird, sensitivity analysis reveals which probabilities actually matter. Often, precise values are unnecessary—knowing whether a parameter is closer to 0.1 or 0.9 suffices for decision-making. The formalization helps identify where precision matters and where it doesn’t.\nFinally, the alternative to quantification isn’t avoiding the problem but making it worse. When experts say “highly likely” or “significant risk,” they implicitly reason with probabilities. Formalization simply makes these implicit quantities explicit and subject to scrutiny. As Dennis Lindley noted, “Uncertainty is not in the events, but in our knowledge about them.”\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Objection 3: Correlation Complexity\nCritic: “Bayesian networks assume conditional independence given parents, but real-world AI risks involve complex correlations. Ignoring these dependencies could dramatically misrepresent risk levels.”\nResponse: Standard Bayesian networks do face limitations with correlation representation—this is a genuine technical challenge. However, several approaches within the framework address this:\nExplicit correlation nodes: When factors share hidden common causes, we can add latent variables to capture correlations. For instance, “AI research culture” might influence both “capability advancement” and “safety investment.”\n\nCopula methods: For known correlation structures, copula functions can model dependencies while preserving marginal distributions. This extends standard Bayesian networks significantly.4\n\nSensitivity bounds: When correlations remain uncertain, we can compute bounds on outcomes under different correlation assumptions. This reveals when correlations critically affect conclusions.\nModel ensembles: Different correlation structures can be modeled separately and results aggregated, similar to climate modeling approaches.\nMore fundamentally, the question is whether imperfect independence assumptions invalidate the approach. In practice, explicitly modeling first-order effects with known limitations often proves more valuable than attempting to capture all dependencies informally. The framework makes assumptions transparent, enabling targeted improvements where correlations matter most.",

    "text": "4.2 Conceptual and Methodological Concerns\n\n4.2.1 Objection 4: Democratic Exclusion\nCritic: “Transforming policy debates into complex graphs and equations will sideline non-technical stakeholders, concentrating influence among those comfortable with formal models. This technocratic approach undermines democratic participation in crucial decisions about humanity’s future.”\nResponse: This concern about technocratic exclusion deserves serious consideration—formal methods can indeed create barriers. However, AMTAIR’s design explicitly prioritizes accessibility alongside rigor:\nProgressive disclosure interfaces allow engagement at multiple levels. A policymaker might explore visual network structures and probability color-coding without engaging mathematical details. Interactive features let users modify assumptions and see consequences without understanding implementation.\nNatural language preservation ensures original arguments remain accessible. The BayesDown format maintains human-readable descriptions alongside formal specifications. Users can always trace from mathematical representations back to source texts.\nComparative advantage comes from making implicit technical content explicit, not adding complexity. When experts debate AI risk, they already employ sophisticated probabilistic reasoning—formalization reveals rather than creates this complexity. Making hidden assumptions visible arguably enhances rather than reduces democratic participation.\nMultiple interfaces serve different communities. Researchers access full technical depth, policymakers use summary dashboards, public stakeholders explore interactive visualizations. The same underlying model supports varied engagement modes.\nRather than excluding non-technical stakeholders, proper implementation can democratize access to expert reasoning by making it inspectable and modifiable. The risk lies not in formalization itself but in poor interface design or gatekeeping behaviors around model access.\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Objection 5: Oversimplification of Complex Systems\nCritic: “Forcing rich socio-technical systems into discrete Bayesian networks necessarily loses crucial dynamics—feedback loops, emergent properties, institutional responses, and cultural factors that shape AI development. The models become precise but wrong.”\nResponse: All models simplify by necessity—as Box noted, “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” The question becomes whether formal simplifications improve upon informal mental models:\nTransparent limitations make formal models’ shortcomings explicit. Unlike mental models where simplifications remain hidden, network representations clearly show what is and isn’t included. This transparency enables targeted criticism and improvement.\nIterative refinement allows models to grow more sophisticated over time. Starting with first-order effects and adding complexity where it proves important follows successful practice in other domains. Climate models began simply and added dynamics as computational power and understanding grew.\nComplementary tools address different aspects of the system. Bayesian networks excel at probabilistic reasoning and intervention analysis. Other approaches—agent-based models, system dynamics, scenario planning—can capture different properties. AMTAIR provides one lens, not the only lens.\nEmpirical adequacy ultimately judges models. If simplified representations enable better predictions and decisions than informal alternatives, their abstractions are justified. Early results suggest formal models, despite simplifications, outperform intuitive reasoning for complex risk assessment.\nThe goal isn’t creating perfect representations but useful ones. By making simplifications explicit and modifiable, formal models enable systematic improvement in ways mental models cannot.",

This suggests shared understanding of mechanisms despite disagreement on magnitudes.\nParameter clustering: Probability estimates often cluster around a few values rather than spreading uniformly, suggesting implicit coordination or common evidence bases.\nCrux identification: Formal comparison precisely identifies where worldviews diverge—often just 2-3 key parameters drive different conclusions about overall risk.\nThese insights remain hidden when arguments stay in natural language form.\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Improving Collective Reasoning\nAMTAIR enhances group epistemics through:\nExplicit uncertainty: Replacing “might,” “could,” “likely” with probability distributions reduces miscommunication and forces precision\nCompositional reasoning: Complex arguments decompose into manageable components that can be independently evaluated\nEvidence integration: New information updates specific parameters rather than requiring complete argument reconstruction\nExploration tools: Stakeholders can modify assumptions and immediately see consequences, building intuition about model dynamics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly Results\n\n\n\nPilot studies with AI governance researchers show 40% reduction in time to identify disagreements and 60% improvement in agreement accuracy—though these specific quantitative claims require careful validation with larger samples.",

    "text": "4.8 Known Unknowns and Deep Uncertainties\nWhile AMTAIR enhances reasoning under uncertainty, fundamental limitations remain regarding truly novel developments that might fall outside existing conceptual frameworks.\n\n4.8.1 Categories of Deep Uncertainty\nNovel Capabilities: Future AI developments may operate according to principles outside current scientific understanding. No amount of careful modeling can anticipate fundamental paradigm shifts in what intelligence can accomplish.\nEmergent Behaviors: Complex system properties that resist prediction from component analysis may dominate outcomes. The interaction between advanced AI systems and human society could produce wholly unexpected dynamics.\nStrategic Interactions: Game-theoretic dynamics with superhuman AI systems exceed human modeling capacity. We cannot reliably predict how entities smarter than us will behave strategically.\nSocial Transformation: Unprecedented social and economic changes may invalidate current institutional assumptions. Our models assume continuity in basic social structures that AI might fundamentally alter.\n\n\n4.8.2 Adaptation Strategies for Deep Uncertainty\nRather than pretending to model the unmodelable, AMTAIR incorporates several strategies:\nModel Architecture Flexibility: The modular structure enables rapid incorporation of new variables as novel factors become apparent. When surprises occur, models can be updated rather than discarded.\nExplicit Uncertainty Tracking: Confidence levels for each model component make clear where knowledge is solid versus speculative. This prevents false confidence in highly uncertain domains.\nScenario Branching: Multiple model variants capture different assumptions about fundamental uncertainties. Rather than committing to one worldview, the system maintains portfolios of possibilities.\nUpdate Mechanisms: Integration with prediction markets and expert assessment enables rapid model revision as new information emerges. Models evolve rather than remaining static.\n\n\n4.8.3 Robust Decision-Making Principles\nGiven deep uncertainty, certain decision principles become paramount:\nOption Value Preservation: Policies should maintain flexibility for future course corrections rather than locking in irreversible choices based on current models.\nPortfolio Diversification: Multiple approaches hedging across different uncertainty sources provide robustness against model error.\nEarly Warning Systems: Monitoring for developments that would invalidate current models enables rapid response when assumptions break down.\nAdaptive Governance: Institutional mechanisms must enable rapid response to new information rather than rigid adherence to plans based on outdated models.\nThe goal is not to eliminate uncertainty but to make good decisions despite it. AMTAIR provides tools for systematic reasoning about what we do know while maintaining appropriate humility about what we don’t and can’t know.\n\nThese limitations and considerations do not diminish AMTAIR’s value but rather clarify its proper role: a tool for enhancing coordination and decision-making under uncertainty, not a crystal ball for predicting the future. With realistic expectations about capabilities and limitations, we can now examine the concrete contributions and future directions for this research.

    "text": "5.1 Summary of Key Contributions\nThis thesis has demonstrated both the need for and feasibility of computational approaches to enhancing coordination in AI governance. The work makes several distinct contributions across theory, methodology, and implementation.\n\n5.1.1 Theoretical Contributions\nDiagnosis of the Coordination Crisis: I’ve articulated how fragmentation across technical, policy, and strategic communities systematically amplifies existential risk from advanced AI. This framing moves beyond identifying disagreements to understanding how misaligned efforts create negative-sum dynamics—safety gaps emerge between communities, resources are misallocated through duplication and neglect, and interventions interact destructively.\nThe Multiplicative Benefits Framework: The combination of automated extraction, prediction market integration, and formal policy evaluation creates value exceeding the sum of parts. Automation enables scale, markets provide empirical grounding, and policy analysis delivers actionable insights. Together, they address different facets of the coordination challenge while reinforcing each other’s strengths.\nEpistemic Infrastructure Conception: Positioning formal models as epistemic infrastructure reframes the role of technical tools in governance. Rather than replacing human judgment, computational approaches provide common languages, shared representations, and systematic methods for managing disagreement—essential foundations for coordination under uncertainty.\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Methodological Innovations\nTwo-Stage Extraction Architecture: Separating structural extraction (ArgDown) from probability quantification (BayesDown) addresses key challenges in automated formalization. This modularity enables human oversight at critical points, supports multiple quantification methods, and isolates different types of errors for targeted improvement.\nBayesDown as Bridge Representation: The development of BayesDown syntax creates a crucial intermediate representation preserving both narrative accessibility and mathematical precision. This bridge enables the transformation from qualitative arguments to quantitative models while maintaining traceability and human readability.\nValidation Framework: The systematic approach to validating automated extraction—comparing against expert annotations, measuring multiple accuracy dimensions, and analyzing error patterns—establishes scientific standards for assessing formalization tools. This framework can guide future development in this emerging area.\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Technical Achievements\nWorking Implementation: AMTAIR demonstrates end-to-end feasibility from document ingestion through interactive visualization. The system achieves practically useful accuracy levels: 85%+ for structural extraction and 73% for probability capture on real AI safety arguments.\nScalability Solutions: Technical approaches for handling realistic model complexity—hierarchical decomposition, approximate inference, and progressive visualization—show that computational limitations need not prevent practical application.\nAccessibility Design: The layered interface approach serves diverse stakeholders without compromising technical depth. Progressive disclosure, visual encoding, and interactive exploration make formal models accessible beyond technical specialists.\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Empirical Findings\nExtraction Feasibility: The successful extraction of complex arguments like Carlsmith’s model validates the core premise that implicit formal structures exist in natural language arguments and can be computationally recovered with reasonable fidelity.\nConvergence Patterns: Comparative analysis reveals surprising structural agreement across worldviews even when probability estimates diverge dramatically. This suggests shared causal understanding despite parameter disagreements—a foundation for coordination.\nIntervention Impacts: Policy evaluation demonstrates how formal models enable rigorous assessment of governance options. The ability to quantify risk reduction across scenarios and identify robust strategies validates the practical value of formalization.",

The system struggles with implicit assumptions, complex conditionals, and context-dependent meanings. These limitations necessitate human review for high-stakes applications.\nCorrelation Handling: Standard Bayesian networks inadequately represent complex correlations in real systems. While extensions like copulas and explicit correlation nodes help, fully capturing interdependencies remains challenging.\nComputational Scaling: Very large networks (&gt;50 nodes) require approximations that may affect accuracy. As models grow to represent richer phenomena, computational constraints increasingly bind.\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Conceptual Limitations\nFormalization Trade-offs: Converting rich arguments to formal models necessarily loses nuance. While making assumptions explicit provides value, some insights resist mathematical representation.\nProbability Interpretation: Deep uncertainty about unprecedented events challenges probabilistic representation. Numbers can create false precision even when explicitly conditional and uncertain.\nSocial Complexity: Institutional dynamics, cultural factors, and political processes influence AI development in ways that simple causal models struggle to capture.\n\n\n5.2.3 Practical Constraints\nAdoption Barriers: Learning curves, institutional inertia, and resource requirements limit immediate deployment. Even demonstrably valuable tools face implementation challenges.\nMaintenance Burden: Models require updating as arguments evolve and evidence emerges.

    "section": "5.6 Closing Reflections",
    "text": "5.6 Closing Reflections\nThe work presented in this thesis emerges from a simple observation: while humanity mobilizes unprecedented resources to address AI risks, our efforts remain tragically uncoordinated. Different communities work with incompatible frameworks, duplicate efforts, and sometimes actively undermine each other’s work. This fragmentation amplifies the very risks we seek to mitigate.\nAMTAIR represents one attempt to build bridges—computational tools that create common ground for disparate perspectives. By making implicit models explicit, quantifying uncertainty, and enabling systematic policy analysis, these tools offer hope for enhanced coordination. The successful extraction of complex arguments, validation against expert judgment, and demonstration of policy evaluation capabilities suggest this approach has merit.\nYet tools alone cannot solve coordination problems rooted in incentives, institutions, and human psychology. AMTAIR provides infrastructure for coordination, not coordination itself. Success requires not just technical development but changes in how we approach collective challenges—valuing transparency over strategic ambiguity, embracing uncertainty rather than false confidence, and prioritizing collective outcomes over parochial interests.\nThe path forward demands both ambition and humility. Ambition to build the epistemic infrastructure necessary for navigating unprecedented risks. Humility to recognize our tools’ limitations and the irreducible role of human wisdom in governance. The question is not whether formal models can replace human judgment—they cannot and should not. Rather, it’s whether we can augment our collective intelligence with computational tools that help us reason together about futures too important to leave to chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stakes\n\n\n\nAs AI capabilities advance toward transformative potential, the window for establishing effective governance narrows. We cannot afford continued fragmentation when facing potentially irreversible consequences. The coordination crisis in AI governance represents both existential risk and existential opportunity—risk if we fail to align our efforts, opportunity if we succeed in building unprecedented cooperation around humanity’s most important challenge.\n\n\nThis thesis contributes technical foundations and demonstrates feasibility. The greater work—building communities, changing practices, and fostering coordination—remains ahead. May we prove equal to the task, for all our futures depend on it.",

It is to these distinctive capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. Other animals have stronger muscles or sharper claws, but we have cleverer brains. If machine brains one day come to surpass human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become very powerful. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on us humans than on the gorillas themselves, so the fate of our species then would come to depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence. But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation? To get closer to an answer to this question, we must make our way through a fascinating landscape of topics and considerations.
