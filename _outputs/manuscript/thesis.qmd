# Abstract {.unnumbered}

The coordination crisis in AI governance presents a paradoxical challenge: unprecedented investment in AI safety coexists alongside fundamental coordination failures across technical, policy, and ethical domains. These divisions systematically increase existential risk by creating safety gaps, misallocating resources, and fostering inconsistent approaches to interdependent problems. This thesis introduces AMTAIR (Automating Transformative AI Risk Modeling), a computational approach that addresses this coordination failure by automating the extraction of probabilistic world models from AI safety literature using frontier language models.

The AMTAIR system implements an end-to-end pipeline that transforms unstructured text into interactive Bayesian networks through a novel two-stage extraction process: first capturing argument structure in ArgDown format, then enhancing it with probability information in BayesDown. This approach bridges communication gaps between stakeholders by making implicit models explicit, enabling comparison across different worldviews, providing a common language for discussing probabilistic relationships, and supporting policy evaluation across diverse scenarios.

        Tips for sources:
        Good Journals:
            Top5 (AmericanEconomicReview, Journal of Political Economy, Econometrica, Quarterly Journal of Economics, Review of Economics Studies);
            NBER, CESifo etc Working Paper;
            Good Field Journals;
            Handelsblatt Ranking etc.
            Always ask:
                Do they conduct proper Peer-review?
                Who are the authors?
           Careful with Thinktanks, research whether they are biased
        Cite your supervisour
            Always a nice move
            Make extra sure you understand their paper
            Unfortunate spot for a mistake
        The References (Bibliography) should contain only that sources that you are referringto in the text, listed in alphabetical orler:oMonographs: surname, given name(s) resp. initials, (editor), year, title,subtitle, edition, volume, place of publication.

    Articles in miscellanies: surname, given name(s), year, title of the article, in:surname, name(s), (editor), year, title, ..., page numbers.
    If in doubt, have a look at the bibliography in papers that are published in the American Economic Review.
    •Sources of all figures and tables which you have adopted from other texts have to be cited precisely (i.e. including the exact page)
